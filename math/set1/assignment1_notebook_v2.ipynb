The population mortality from seasonal influenza is generally thought to be about 0.01% (1 death per 10000 people). Write your code to find and print out the list of countries with the population mortality greater than ten times of the population mortality of seasonal influenza. (**2 marks**)\n",
    "3. Write your code to find and print out the country with the highest population mortality. Both the country code and the mortality value for this country need to be printed out (**2 marks**)\n",
    "4. Write your code to construct a dictionary variable ***data_large_countries*** whose keys are **iso_code**, **total_cases_per_million**, **total_deaths_per_million**, **population**, **population_density**. You can start from the original dataset **data_dict** and adapt the code given to you in Instruction 2 (Task 1). Alternatively, you can use **data_filtered_by_date** and then filter the countries by population. Print the generated dictionary. (**2 marks**)\n",
    "5. Using the new dictionary ***data_large_countries***, plot a bar chart of mortality sorted in descending order of values for the countries with **population** more than 1 million, achieving first twenty places of leadership in exterminating their own population using COVID. (**3 marks**)\n",
    "6. Using the same dictionary, plot a bar chart of total cases and population density for the mortality leaders. Use the same order of countries as in Task 5. (**3 marks**)\n",
