    "###**Computing**\n",
    "The computation stage within the data science pipeline is where you can finally do something useful to the data that you have been carefully preparing. Although it can involve visualizations, this stage is also about building models and doing analysis including pattern discovery, machine learning, etc. This stage usually requires the most creativity and hence is the most fun.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately for this example, the end goal is not too exciting -- it's only to build a 'table'. As we saw earlier, our goal is to produce the following table (words and numbers made up):\n",
    "```\n",
    "word,  count \n",
    "the,   400 \n",
    "Tom,   305 \n",

    "Python has a set of useful containers to manage data in the collections module. Specifically, the Counter type is a great way to keep track of the counts of unique items. For example, here is a simple example:\n",
