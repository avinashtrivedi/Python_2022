    "#**Lesson Remote I/O**\n",
    "###**using HTTP to get resources**\n",
    "In a previous lesson we learned about getting data from a 'local' resource -- specifically a file resource. We are going to build upon that knowledge to learn how to access resources on the Internet. As you will see, the steps of opening a resource, reading the resource, and then closing it are still present. However, we will be using different Python APIs (application programming interfaces) for working with different libraries to access remote resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "###**Too much terminology**\n",
    "This lesson is packed with potentially new words, concepts, and acronyms. Read slowly. If you don't understand something, reach out and ask questions -- we will be happy to clarify. Let's go over some of the terminology for accessing remote content.\n",
    "\n",
    "###**Protocols**\n",
    "Almost all the resources we will access will be available via **HTTP** (HyperText Transfer Protocol) and HTTP**S** (Secure) *protocol*. A **protocol** is simply a set of rules that each participant in the data exchange must adhere to for communication to happen. These protocols are built on top of other well established 'Internet' protocols such as **TCP** (Transfer Control Protocol -- which helps in reliable data delivery) and **IP** (Internet Protocol -- which helps in routing data from one machine to another) that utilize an engineering technique called **layering** (much like the data science pipeline) -- where each protocol (or step in the pipeline) can use the protocol it's building upon (or the previous step in the pipeline).\n",
    "\n",
    "###**Web Services**\n",
    "Almost any resource that is accessible via HTTP/S has a web server listening to a specific **port** on a machine. A port (80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS) is just a mechanism for the operating system to know how to hand off incoming network data to the correct process. A closely related idea is that of a **web service**. A web service uses the same technologies of a web server, however, the requester for data to a web service is typically another computer (not a person, but a program).\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have heard of **REST** (Representational State Transfer) and **SOAP** (Simple Object Access Protocol) that further define rules on how to access resources using HTTP (SOAP uses *SMTP*). Both of these are typical protocols used by web services -- they need to tightly define the rules for locating a resource and for the **encoding** (rules to package the data) the data to send.\n",
    "\n",
    "###**Words that Connect**\n",
    "For every request you make (using HTTP, for example) to a server there's some basic terminology that needs to be memorized.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=19HU2EsmTTyrVYYGxh75eTwZrDnxeISO-)\n",
    "\n",
    "image [source](https://hackernoon.com/http-made-easy-understanding-the-web-client-server-communication-yz783vg3) \n",
    "\n",
    "The **client** is the host that is making the request for some resource. For example, in most web requests, the browser is the client. When we write python code to download a book, our code is the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **server** (the thing that manages the resource) handles the request and returns a response. So for every connection, there is a client, a server, a request and a response. The client and server can be the same physical machine as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "###**Request Types**\n",
    "if a resource can be accessed via a URL (in the browser address bar) the request is called a **GET request** (**POST request**s puts the data in the request message or body and not in the URL). We will focus most of our attention on simple HTTP GET requests. There are other types of HTTP requests (e.g. POST, PUT, DELETE)."

    "#**The URL**\n",
    "Of course the most important part of a remote request will be the **URL** (Uniform Resource Locator). The URL is a string that identifies a resource and how to access it. It is made up of several components. Knowing these components will help you navigate Python documentation that describes how to manipulate different parts of the URL and/or the connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "###**URL by Example**\n",
    "Let's look at a simple URL:\n",
    "```\n",
    "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/76/76-0.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and look at how it can be broken down into different components.\n",
    "\n",
    "###**The Scheme**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **http**://www.gutenberg.org/files/76/76-0.txt\n",
    "The scheme identifies what communication protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) will be used to access the resource. It is usually HTTP or HTTPS, but can also be something like FTP (File Transfer Protocol -- an old protocol for getting files) as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "###**The Host:Port**\n",
    "The next item is the hostname followed by a port number. If the port number is not specified, the default port is used. Hostnames can be specified via **DNS** names (Domain Name Service) or IP addresses:\n",
    "\n",
    "* http://**www.gutenberg.org**/files/76/76-0.txt\n",
    "* http://**www.gutenberg.org:80**/files/76/76-0.txt\n",
    "* http://**173.194.219.113:80**\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, we use DNS names for identifying the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "###**The Path**\n",
    "The path identifies the specific resource the client (e.g. the web browser) wants to access on the server:\n",
    "\n",
    "* http://www.gutenberg.org **/files/76/76-0.txt**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case the path is a specific file, but a resource could be a script (like **php** -- another coding language) or a program that gets run/executed on the server and whose output is the response (e.g. an SQL or database query).\n",
    "\n",
    "###**The Query String**\n",
    "The query string is optional but it allows you to pass additional information to the web server to access different aspects of the resource. For example, the following URL contains the query parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php? **action=parse&format=json&page=Steve+Jobs&prop=text**\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameters are action, format, page, prop. In this case we are retrieving data from a web service (the output isn't meant for our visual consumption). The query field starts with a ? and each key/value pair is separated with the & symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "###**URL encoding**\n",
    "You may have noticed that the URL used to request a resource cannot contain a space.\n",
    "There are other characters that are also not allowed as well. You can see the original [specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-2). The Request for Comments (RFC) document(s) have been used by the Internet community to define new standards and share technical information.\n",
    "\n",
    "For query values that have special characters or spaces, you will need to encode them. URL encoding involves translating unprintable characters or characters with special meaning within URLs to a representation that is unambiguous and universally accepted by web browsers and servers. In the above query to Wikipedia, notice that for the page parameter, the space is replaced with a + character. You can also use the %20 character(s) to encode the space:\n",
    "\n",
    "* https://www.google.com/search?as_q=apollo%2013\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost all browsers will encode the URL for you when you type it in the address bar of the browser; however, the Python libraries **will not**. You will have to encode them yourself or with the provided functions."

    "###**Header Fields**\n",
    "You can set and read different aspects of the HTTP request and response that define the details of the communication between the client and the server. HTTP headers define the operating parameters for the process of data transfer from source to destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "They can also provide information *about* the source and destination, determine the data transmission mode and encoding type. Headers also specify information about the content, its type and size, and can be used to restrict the amount and variety of data allowed at both ends of the communication. To ensure security, values in the header can specify the time for which data will be valid, mandate that each side of the communication proves their legitimacy and identity, keep unwanted readers from reading, and ensure data integrity with the help of hash values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Headers can also provide information about the client, server, and the application handling the HTTP communication environment. Things like **cookies** (information saved on the client), **cache control** (using 'old' information), **authorization** (who is allowed), etc are normally handled by setting the correct header fields in a request. Although we won't be setting or reading the headers, you should know that capability exists."

The most important is that of the **status code**. A status code is a numeric value the server sends to the client (you may have seen a 404 status code before -- which means the resource requested does not exist).\n",
    "\n",
    "A status code of 200, means the request was completed without any errors. When the status code is not OK (i.e. not 200), you should at least log the error and determine how to handle the response.
