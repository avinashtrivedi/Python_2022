If your code does not execute, partial credit will be given for elements of the code which are correct, and for evidence of effective debugging. If answering a question requires information from the previous part of the question, then you may substitute dummy values (e.g. create a new string, list or values) to demonstrate that you know how to solve that part of the question."

    "The for statement iterates through a collection or iterable object or generator function whereas the while statement simply loops until a condition is False. For loops can be used to specify a range of values within data for the program to read whereas you can not do that in while loops (e.g can specify range that i will loop for). While loops will loop wihin a particular dataset indefinitely until the condition is not met anymore (e.g until a particular sequence is encountered). For loops are traditionally used for example in instances where we would want to find a particular element within a DNA sequence - for example a start or stop codon. A while loop could be used to loop over a dataset that is changing or being altered over a period of time. "
