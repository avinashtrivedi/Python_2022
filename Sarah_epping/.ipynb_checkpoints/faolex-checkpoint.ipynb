       3 | p a g e       1. foreword     starting in 2010 – 2011, the government of nigeria, after years of benign neglect, began to reform  the agriculture sector.  to refocus the sector, the government implemented a new strategy, the  agricultural transformation agenda (ata). in 2011-2016, the focus was on rebuilding a sector whose  relevance had shrunk dramatically. that was reflected in the lack of lending to farmers by the financial  system and the dramatic levels of food imports from across the world.  that intervention, the ata,  served its core purpose of helping refocus nigeria’s attention on agriculture.     today, as we evaluate the progress made under the ata, it is apparent that additional work is still  required in order to meet our objectives. nigeria still imports a significant amount of food. nigeria is  also not earning significant foreign exchange from agriculture, meaning we are losing on both ends.  therefore, it became paramount to “refresh our strategy” to tackle these 2 issues head on.  the  agricultural promotion policy (app) is that refreshed strategy.     the purpose therefore of this policy document is to provide a disciplined approach to building an  agribusiness ecosystem that will solve these 2 gaps. the private sector will remain in the lead while  government facilitates, as well as provides supporting infrastructure, systems, control processes, and  oversight. the key federal mdas will take on more of a regulator’s role to ensure a nuanced  commercial development of the market necessary to close these two gaps.    the success of the new policy will be driven by the levels of engagement of market place participants,  farmers, states, investors, financial institutions, and communities. other stakeholders from research  laboratories to the nigeria customs service to donors will also play vital roles. performance will be  tracked and published periodically to help inform smart decision making, but also to reinforce our  fundamental goal of leveraging the capabilities of nigeria to ensure food and income security.    the ministry and its partners believe that the app will be a platform for generating enduring results,  and we look forward to delivering on its promise.    chief audu ogbeh  honourable minister, federal ministry of agriculture & rural development  june 21, 2016  abuja fct, nigeria                4 | p a g e     2. acknowledgement of stakeholders     this policy document is the outcome of an intensive consultative process starting in november 2015  through april 2016, and involving multiple stakeholders. from farmer groups to investors to  processors to lenders to civil servants to academics, many stakeholders provided detailed input,  commentary, and support. we are grateful for the resources, energy and intellect put at the disposal  of the federal ministry of agriculture & rural development by parties too numerous to mention.  thank you for your continued dedication and resolve to build a next generation agribusiness economy  in nigeria.                 5 | p a g e     3. executive summary     nigeria is facing two key gaps in agriculture today: an inability to meet domestic food requirements,  and an inability to export at quality levels required for market success. the former problem is a  productivity challenge driven by an input system and farming model that is largely inefficient. as a  result, an aging population of farmers do not have enough seeds, fertilizers, irrigation, crop protection  and related support to be successful. the latter challenge is driven by an equally inefficient system for  setting and enforcing food quality standards, as well as poor knowledge of target markets. insufficient  food testing facilities, a weak inspectorate system in fmard, and poor coordination among relevant  federal agencies serve to compound early stage problems such as poor knowledge of permissible  contaminant levels.    putting nigeria’s agriculture sector on a path to growth will require actions to solve these two gaps:  produce enough fresh, high quality foods for the nigerian market; and serve the export market  successfully and earn foreign exchange. the new federal agricultural promotion policy (app) is a  strategy that focuses on solving the core issues at the heart of limited food production and delivery of  quality standards. as productivity improves domestically and standards are raised for all nigerian food  production, export markets will also benefit impacting positively on nigeria’s balance of payments.  given limited resources and the importance of delivering sustainable results, the federal ministry of  agriculture & rural development (fmard) in consultation with partners has identified an initial pool  of crops and related activities that will be nigeria’s path to tackling the aforementioned gaps.     first, fmard will prioritize improving productivity into a number of domestically focused crops and  activities. these are rice, wheat, maize, fish (aquaculture), dairy milk, soya beans, poultry, horticulture  (fruits and vegetables), and sugar. nigeria believes that the gap can be closed by partnering closely  with private investors across farmer groups and companies to develop end to end value chain  solutions. these chains will receive facilitated government support as they make deep commitments  to engaging a new generation of farmers, improving supply of specialized fertilizers and protection  chemicals, as well as wider scale use of high yielding seeds. in addition, nigeria expects to work with  investors to sharply improve the distribution system for fresh foods so as to reduce time to table,  reduce post-harvest losses, and overall improve nutritional outcomes e.g. lowering of diabetic risk,  stunting risk, etc.     second, fmard will prioritize for export markets the production of the following crops and activities:  cowpeas, cocoa, cashew, cassava (starch, chips and ethanol), ginger, sesame, oil palm, yams,  horticulture (fruits and vegetables), beef and cotton. fmard will also work with a network of  investors, farmers, processors and other stakeholders to deepen the supporting infrastructure to  ensure that quality standards are defined and maintained across the value chain. that will involve  adding more testing laboratories, improving traceability of crops, disseminating intelligence on export  markets and consumer preferences, etc. our goal is to build a high quality brand for nigerian foods  based on rigorous data and processes that protect food safety for both domestic and export market  consumers.    to ensure that the strategy is executed as intended, fmard is working closely with states and other  federal mdas e.g. power, transportation and trade. fmard will also evolve itself to become a more  focused policy maker and regulator to ensure accountability for results.  fmard will use its convening  and related powers to ensure that the enabling system is in place to support agribusiness. from  investments in rural roads to reduce transport time to improved security of farming communities to  reduce incidence of criminality to reduction in intra-state taxes and levies, fmard will intensify          6 | p a g e     oversight. that oversight will ensure that farmers and investors are working in a market that is safe,  competitive, and capable of enabling wealth creation in the coming years and decades.     finally, fmard will periodically publish metrics to track performance against the strategy e.g. tonnage  of rice paddy produced, or yields/milking cow. the systems to repeatedly collect accurate data and  integrate these into policy making, as well as investor planning will be refined over the next few  months as part of this next wave of reform. we anticipate that if successful, key gaps such as nigeria’s  continued imports of rice will disappear, while nigerian produce e.g. beans and cocoa will once again  become a quality benchmark across the globe. reaching that point will require significant investments  in people, processes and systems.  nigeria is committed to taking the necessary steps in order to move  nigerian agriculture from “a business” to a commercial ecosystem that can produce the capabilities  necessary to create sustainable jobs and wealth.                  7 | p a g e     4. introduction to the agricultural promotion policy (app)      4.1   building on the ata legacy    starting in 2010 – 2011, the government of nigeria, after years of benign neglect, began to reform  the agriculture sector.  to refocus the sector, the government implemented a new strategy (the  agricultural transformation agenda, ata) built on the principle that agriculture is a business and  therefore policy should be about supporting it.  the main priority of policy was to “restart the clock”  and reintroduce the nigerian economy to sustainable agriculture centered on business-like attitude  driven by the private sector.  that strategy was in place from 2011 – 2015.     the ata was a good platform to re-engage key stakeholders in nigerian agriculture to shift focus  towards how a self-sustaining agribusiness focused economy could be built. the ata focused on how  to make nigeria’s agriculture more productive, efficient and effective.  it set a target of creating 3.5  million jobs by 2015; generating foreign exchange, and reducing spending on food imports. among its  key achievements was a restructuring of the federal fertilizer procurement system.  below is a brief  summary of some of the key successes of the ata:    table 1: select ata achievements (2011 – 2015) by value chain stage  area  illustrative achievements  input supply  \\uf0b7  set-up of the growth enhancement scheme (ges) to register small holder  farmers and provide targeted input subsidies (e-wallet)  o ges database contains 10.5 million farmers (data integrity not  verifiable)   o targeted means-based subsidies provided to an ~12 to 14 million  farmers between 2011 – 2014   \\uf0b7  farmers gained improved access to inputs i.e. access to fertilizer and of  seeds

\\uf0b7  engagement with commercial banks to finance ges and boost lending to  agriculture from ~1% to 6% of all formal credit by 2015  \\uf0b7  creation of special funds to support farmers e.g. n10b

\\uf0b7  concession of federal warehouses and storage assets  production  \\uf0b7  introduction of new higher yielding crop varieties e.g. cocoa, rice (faro 42  and 44)  \\uf0b7  domestic food production rose by an incremental 20.1m tons (claims not  evidence based)  o rice paddy production rose an estimated 2.0 – 2.5 million tons  \\uf0b7  creation of a federal dept. of agricultural extension   market access  \\uf0b7  re-establishment of select commodity marketing boards e.g. cocoa  marketing corporation  others  \\uf0b7  reform of the agricultural research network (arcn)            8 | p a g e     ata however also faced challenges and did not deliver on all the targets identified.  for example,  nigeria still imports about $3 to $5 billion worth of food annually, especially wheat, rice, fish and  sundry items, including fresh fruits.  as a result, nigeria is not food secure. wastage levels remain high  in production areas, reducing supply of feedstock to processing factories, requiring them to keep  importing supplies.  the net effect is limited job growth across the agricultural value chain from input  production to market systems, and continued use of limited foreign currency earnings to import vast  quantities of food.     below are summarized some of the ata’s shortcomings which have to be tackled in the app:     table 2: select ata challenges (2011 – 2015) and production gaps by value chain stage  area  illustrative shortcomings  input supply  \\uf0b7  ges’s limited focus and exit strategy set aside, with material implications  for ministry’s

improved variety seeds e.g. still a 300,000mt gap  between demand and supply of seeds  financing  \\uf0b7  credit access particularly for small holders remains weak  o nirsal’s 2013 change in credit

into infrastructure and midstream logistics e.g.  warehouses, storage, processing systems remains rudimentary  \\uf0b7  staple crop processing zone (scpz) strategy has not yield results.  for  example, kogi scpz  has not taken off due to withdrawal of cargill, the  anchor investor from the project  production  \\uf0b7  growth in food production remains limited due to gaps in input supplies  e.g. rice; hence rice imports still exceed $1 billion/annum. outlined below  is an illustrative “best estimates1” of demand-supply gaps given data  quality issues still present in nigeria. it is anticipated that as production  gaps are closed via yield improvements, per/ton equivalent costs will also  decline, helping reduce food costs and ultimately, inflation.   market access  \\uf0b7  post-harvest losses still an issue but improving moderately  \\uf0b7  illegal food imports remain an issue, depriving farmers of market  opportunities  others  \\uf0b7  federal – state coordination of

extracts and glucose  syrup is currently used to manage gap, hence a  commercial threat for nigerian farmers    on balance, the ata was an important first step towards rediscovering agriculture.  as a result, many  companies, individuals and donors are now keen to invest in nigerian agriculture once again.  agriculture is viewed as a business that can provide a reasonable basis for further wealth and job  growth in nigeria.     with that in mind, the policy and strategic focus is now on how to build on the initial progress made,  and transition nigeria to a new plane in terms of agribusiness performance. that will be the focus of  the proposed new policy regime.  that new policy’s primary focus will be on closing the demand –  supply gaps between crop and livestock production.  gap closing will also include tackling related  input, financing, storage, transport and market access issues present in key value chains.              10 | p a g e     4.2   the buhari administration’s vision and approach    building on the successes and lessons from the ata, the vision of the buhari administration for  agriculture is to work with key stakeholders to build an agribusiness economy capable of delivering  sustained prosperity by meeting domestic food security goals, generating exports, and supporting  sustainable income and job growth.  in this regard, a number of specific objectives for the period 2016  – 2020 emerge:    \\uf0b7  grow the integrated agriculture sector at 1x to 2x the average nigerian gdp for 2016 – 2020;  sector’s historical growth was between 3% - 6% per annum in 2011 – 2015, hence the need to  raise performance.  assuming gdp growth of 6% in 2017, agriculture would aim to achieve 6%  - 12% , allowing agricultural household income to double in 6 – 12 years, holding all else equal  o agriculture’s share of gdp: 23% (q1 2016)  o agriculture’s share of the labor force: 70%  o agricultural activity mix: crop production: 85%; livestock and other non-crop: 15%  \\uf0b7  integrate agricultural commodity value chains into the broader supply chain of nigerian and  global industry, driving job growth, increasing the contribution of agriculture to wealth  creation, and enhancing the capacity of the country to earn foreign exchange from agricultural  exports;  o agriculture’s share of non-oil exports earnings: 75%  \\uf0b7  promote the responsible use of land, water and other natural resources to create a vibrant  agricultural sector offering employment and livelihood for a growing population;  \\uf0b7  facilitate the government’s capacity to meet its obligations to nigerians on food security, food  safety and quality nutrition  o agriculture’s share of federal budget: ~2.0%  \\uf0b7  create a mechanism for improved governance of agriculture by the supervising institutions,  and improving quality of engagement between the federal and state governments.    unlocking nigeria’s full agricultural potential requires that nigeria solve the underlying challenges in  its agricultural system, which includes the following:    o policy framework: nigeria suffers from policy instability driven by high rate of turnover of  programmes and personnel, which in turn has made the application of policy instruments  unstable.  the outcome is an uneven development pathway for agriculture; lack of policy  accountability, transparency and due process of law, relating to willful violation of the  constitution and subsidiary legislations governing the agriculture sector.  that in turn has  made the business environment unpredictable and discourages investors.  to address this  challenge, nigeria needs to create a policy structure that matches evidence-driven  coordination among decision-making authorities with common and public goals for an  agricultural transformation of the country.  building that evidence base requires that nigeria  adopt a consistent fact base to drive decision making, as well as build on prior successes e.g.  the jonathan administration’s pioneering agricultural transformation agenda (ata).    o political commitment: this pertains to the non-implementation of international protocols or  conventions agreed to with other members of the comity of nations.  for example, nigeria  has failed to achieve the targets in the maputo declaration that prescribes a minimum of 10%  budgetary allocation to the agricultural sector. political commitment at both the federal and  state levels will be required to enforce reforms.  o agricultural technology: persistent shortcomings of the national agricultural research  system (nars) to generate and commercialize new agricultural technologies that meet local          11 | p a g e     market needs.  nars’s challenges have been relatively severe particularly around improved  varieties of seed or other planting materials and breeds of livestock and aquatic species.  the  failure to also deliver already proven technologies available on the shelf to farmers’ fields  where they are needed is a challenge.  addressing these will require better coordination  among extension delivery system, the national agricultural research system, as well as public  and private sector suppliers of agricultural inputs.    o infrastructure deficit: nigeria’s agricultural sector suffers from an infrastructure challenge.  infrastructure such as motor roads, railroads or irrigation dams are either insufficient, or when  available, not cost competitive. they are thus unable to operate to support scale-driven  agriculture.  that imposes an added cost (up to 50% - 100%) on the delivered price of  agricultural produce in nigeria, making it uncompetitive compared to global peers.  in order  to boost farm productivity, raise the level of marketable surplus and expand value chain  participants’ access to low cost infrastructure, nigeria will need to rethink the business and  operating model for agricultural infrastructure     o finance and risk management: nigeria’s agriculture sector continues to have poor access to  financial services that enable farmers and other agricultural producers to adopt new  technologies, improve market linkages, and increase their resilience to economic shocks.  poor  access to financial services that enable input suppliers, processors, traders and others in  agribusiness to address liquidity and encourage targeted private sector engagement in  agriculture remains a challenge.  lending rates still routinely range from 10% to 30% subject  to whether the borrower is considered prime, has access to low cost, government-provided  financing (boa, cbn, boi), or is offered a nirsal plc. -financed interest rate subsidy and credit  guarantee.  to improve financing options and de-risk value chains further, nigeria will need  to intensify innovation in financing ecosystems,    o institutional reform and realignment: today, many federal and state agricultural institutions  only exist on paper. in fact, the system even ignores local government areas which is actually  where a majority of activity takes place.  there is a need to streamline, clarify mandates and  ensure continued accountability for results.  unless these issues are tackled, nigeria will  continue to struggle with the capacity of its agricultural institutions to deliver on their public  mandates.  a turnaround will mean, for example, adding more resources such as adding up to  15,000 extension workers, setting up more operational coordination mechanisms between  the federal government and states in between the national council of agriculture, and linking  rewards to performance.      in addressing these constraints, the government will apply prudent, market based policy measures to  grow the sector, with a clear recognition that widespread poverty reduction through the  transformation of the agriculture sector is integral to the country’s long run economic growth  trajectory and prosperity.  accordingly, this policy statement is anchored on three main pillars in line  with the constitutional provision for the role of federal government in agricultural development:     \\uf0b7  promotion of agricultural investment;  \\uf0b7  financing agricultural development programmes and   \\uf0b7  research for agricultural innovation and productivity.                  12 | p a g e     5. policy thrust and objectives    therefore in 2016 to 2020, nigeria’s policy now needs to be readjusted to solve the aforementioned  challenges.  the go forward federal priorities (in partnership with state governments) will be the  following four: food security; import substitution; job creation; and economic diversification.        the new policy regime, tagged the agriculture promotion policy (app) policy is founded on the  following guiding principles, a number of which are carryovers from the ata reflecting the strong  desire for policy stability.  new elements added reflect the lessons from the ata, as well as priorities  emerging from the aspirations of the buhari administration:    1. agriculture as a business – focusing the policy instruments on a government-enabled,  private sector-led engagement as the main growth driver of the sector.  this essential  principle was established in the ata and will remain a cardinal design principle of nigeria’s  agriculture policies going forward.    2. agriculture as key to long-term economic growth and security—focusing policy  instruments to ensure that the commercialization of agriculture includes technologies,  financial services, inputs supply chains, and market linkages that directly engage rural  poor farmers because rural economic growth will play a critical role in the country’s  successful job creation, economic diversity, improved security and sustainable economic  growth.      3. food as a human right – focusing the policy instruments for agricultural development on  the social responsibility of government with respect to food security, social security and  equity in the nigerian society; and compelling the government to recognize, protect and  fulfill the irreducible minimum degree of freedom of the people from hunger and  malnutrition.    4. value chain approach – focusing the policy instruments for enterprise development  across successive stages of the commodity value chains for the development of crop,  livestock and fisheries sub-sectors, namely input supply, production, storage,  processing/utilization, marketing and consumption.  building complex linkages between  value chain stages will be an important part of the ecosystem that will drive sustained  prosperity for all nigerians.     5. prioritizing crops – focusing policy on achieving improved domestic food security and  boosting export earnings requires a measure of prioritization.  therefore, for domestic  crops, the initial focus in 2016 – 2018 will be expanding the production of rice, wheat,  maize, soya beans and tomatoes. for export crops, the initial focus will be on cocoa,  cassava, oil palm, sesame and gum arabic.  in 2018 onwards, the export focus will add on  bananas, avocado, mango, fish and cashew nuts.  investments in closing infrastructure  gaps to accelerate productivity and investment in these crops will also be sequenced to  reflect capital availability and management attention.    food security import  substitution job creation economic  diversification         13 | p a g e     6. market orientation – focusing policy instruments on stimulating agricultural production  on a sustainable basis, and stimulating supply and demand for agricultural produce by  facilitating linkages between producers and off takers, while stabilizing prices or reducing  price volatility for agricultural produce through market-led price stabilization mechanisms  (commodity exchanges, negotiated off-take agreements, extended farm-gate price under  value chains coordination mechanisms, agricultural insurance, etc.)      7. factoring climate change and environmental sustainability – focusing policy instruments  on the sustainability of the use of natural resources (land and soil, water and ecosystems)  with the future generation in mind while increasing agricultural production, marketing  and other human activities in the agricultural sector.     8. participation and inclusiveness  – focusing instruments on measures to maximize the full  participation of stakeholders including farmer’s associations, cooperatives and other  groups, as well as ngos, cbos, csos, development partners and the private sector.  this  places a premium on the role of these organizations or groups as agents of economic  change in general and agricultural economy in particular, thereby drawing benefits from  their policy advocacy roles as partners to and watchdog of government.    9. policy integrity – focusing policy instruments on measures for sanitizing the business  environment for agriculture, in terms of accountability, transparency and due process of  law, ensuring efficient allocation and use of public funding and fighting corruption on all  programmes involving public resources. this also applies to compliance with international  commitments, protocols and conventions that nigeria is a signatory to.     10. nutrition sensitive agriculture – focusing policy instruments on addressing the issues of  stunting, wasting, underweight and other manifestations of hunger and malnutrition with  particular reference to the vulnerable groups, which include children under 5, nursing  mothers and persons with chronic illness and disabilities    11. agriculture’s linkages with other sectors – focusing policy instruments on the connected  relationship between agriculture and other sectors at federal and state levels, particularly  industry, environment, power, energy, works and water sectors.   within this overall set of policy principles, the federal government will concentrate on providing an  enabling environment for stakeholders at federal and state level to play their distinctive roles.  the policy  emphasis will be on providing a conducive legislative and agricultural knowledge framework, macro  policies, security enhancing physical infrastructure and institutional mechanisms for coordination and  enhancing access to adequate inputs, finance, information on innovation, agricultural services and  markets.      6. approach and process  with the app framework outlined, the next step was to create a roadmap to guide development and  execution.  the process of developing the agriculture sector roadmap was as follows: following the  endorsement of the draft communique at the 2016 national council of agriculture, ten (10) thematic  working groups were established by fmard. each working group was asked to conduct brainstorming and  analysis to identify their sub-sector specific constraints, policy initiatives and suggested programmes. the          14 | p a g e     development of the roadmap as the guiding policy framework for the agricultural sector had the following  set-up and outputs:  a) policy plan   \\uf0b7  preparation of reports by the ten multi-stakeholder working groups on key policy areas   \\uf0b7  harmonization of the inputs into one policy document   \\uf0b7  approval    b) programme plan for identified policy areas with activities and budgets    c) investment plan based on weighted priorities across possible intervention areas      7. thematic interventions to unlock full potential under app    for the app to move nigeria closer to unlocking its full economic potential, constraints have to be  identified, mapped and prioritized.  as noted above, the teams’ set-up by fmard conducted a high  level brainstorming and analysis to map key constraints in the agricultural value chain from production  to consumption.  emerging from that effort, a matrix of constraints were identified that broadly group  into productivity, financing and regulatory constraints.  each team then developed policies and  interventions to act as guidelines for resolving a number of these constraints.  these interventions  and their originating policy choices have been organized into 3 themes as summarised below:    table 3: three organizing themes for app  productivity enhancements   crowding in private sector  investment   fmard institutional  realignment   1. access to land  2. soil fertility  3. access to  information and  knowledge  4. access to inputs  5. production  management  6. storage  7. processing  8. marketing & trade  9. access to finance  10. agribusiness  investment  development    11. institutional setting  and roles  12. youth and women  13. infrastructure  14. climate smart  agriculture  15. research &  innovation  16. food, consumption  and nutrition  security      the discussions, which follow, provide additional detail on the levers within each theme.    4.1. theme 1: productivity enhancements    the discussions that follow are designed to boost system productivity, reduce post-harvest losses and  expand market access related activities. the target outcome is a blend of metrics including but not  limited to rises in farm productivity versus base year (% yield increases), reductions in post-harvest  losses, share of agricultural input used in nigeria by consumer goods companies, and share of  nigerians fresh goods sold in formal markets e.g. shoprite.           15 | p a g e       4.1.1. access to land and land management    background/ constraints:    land is a vital input for agricultural production and regulated access to it is critical.  a key issue is land  title and tenure, which defines the conditions and rules guiding the right to hold a piece of land for  one purpose or another. about 95% of agricultural lands are not titled, effectively nullifying their  capacity to be treated as collateral for financial transactions.  in recent years, the mabogunje  committee’s work began to pilot mechanisms for improving land titling with trial programmes in  select states.  other challenges abound, including the doctrine in the law and the reality of community  control.  for example, the land use act stipulates that state governors hold land in trust for the  people. yet communities where land is situated can, in practice, throw up road blocks to land access,  which contributes to difficulties investors face in acquiring land for agricultural investment. in other  cases, the bureaucracy and approving authorities can also be an obstacle to land allocation even when  the community’s support is not in question.  a number of states have made strong progress in this  area regarding simplifying the process of land allocation, and issuance of certificates of occupancy.      the key constraints are:  \\uf0a7  current land use act is not conducive for agricultural activities (e.g. short-term lease does  not allow for agricultural loans, particularly small holder farmers)  \\uf0a7  process of securing and perfecting title is cumbersome, time-consuming and often  expensive   \\uf0a7  implementation of policies does not do enough to ensure inclusion of women in  agriculture i.e. gender biases in access to land, with women facing more difficulty  accessing land than men  \\uf0a7  land grabbing with communities being dispossessed of large parcels of land  \\uf0a7  unclear rules and governance regarding management of land for use in farming versus  grazing for nomadic cattle populations    policy thrust    policy to pursue amendment of current land use act:  \\uf0a7  facilitating the recognition and entitlement of land ownership by formal or customary  means to assist collateralization;  \\uf0a7  farmer/land registration (identity, location, landholding and soil mapping), and low cost,  web-based and digital mechanisms for verifying the existence of such titles  \\uf0a7  land rights that incentivize small farmers to invest in their land and raise their  productivity;  \\uf0a7  policies that reduce implicit and explicit gender biases in land allocation and titling  processes  \\uf0a7  policies that create a transparent, liquid market for agricultural land, improving likelihood  of land being used as collateral  \\uf0a7  policies that allow the farmers who are commercializing to use other land (aggregate)  rental markets or land markets;   \\uf0a7  policies that enable migration of farmers who have better opportunities elsewhere in the  economy;   \\uf0a7  policies that facilitate establishment of commercial ranches for cattle and reduces risk of  clashes between nomads and farmers          16 | p a g e     \\uf0a7  policies that ensure a balance between economic growth of larger agribusinesses with the  economic cost of displacing small farmers, or creating land shortages over time as the  rural population grows.      this policy should be firmly rooted in spatial predictions of demographic changes in rural areas.      4.1.2. soil fertility    background    soil fertility requires attention in view of the need to maintain adequate levels of macro and micro  soil nutrients under intensive production systems that remove nutrients from agriculture areas. soil  erosion in southeastern nigeria and desertification in the north due to deforestation wash away  topsoil with the nutrient layers and pose a threat to soil fertility. climate change, with temperature  increase, speeds up the breakdown of soil organic matter which is essential for water retention and  root development.    the key constraints are:   \\uf0a7  better targeting of fertilizers to communities where the use of fertilizer is profitable; and  improved incentives for fertilizer supply  \\uf0a7  soil degradation due to inappropriate agricultural practices; soil erosion, deforestation and  climate change  \\uf0a7  cost-effective fertilizer delivery by use of technology  \\uf0a7  insufficient mapping of soils by type as an input into designing fertilizer types  \\uf0a7  challenges of balancing fertilizer supply with market access and demand   \\uf0a7  potential for distortions in fertilizer markets due to the ges subsidy     policy thrust    policy to maintain and enhance soil fertility through:   \\uf0a7  soil mapping and testing  \\uf0a7  crop rotation to improve nitrogen fixation  \\uf0a7  soil fertility reconstruction and formal fallow periods  \\uf0a7  fertilizer quality control  \\uf0a7  use of organic fertilizer   \\uf0a7  erosion control measures e.g. tree planting  \\uf0a7  soil/crop specific fertilizer formulation  \\uf0a7  improved conservation, reforestation and green belt policies  \\uf0a7  review ges subsidy and align with overall fertilizer supply / demand strategy to focus  efforts in regions requiring the most support        4.1.3. access to information and knowledge    background/ constraints     in order to increase agricultural productivity and improve agribusiness, the right information is  required at the right time for planning and decision-making. this is relevant to all stakeholders in the          17 | p a g e     sector, including farmers, input suppliers, processors, traders, policy makers, development partners,  and researchers.  appropriate information can sharpen opportunities, clarify market access, and  enable participants to make choices regarding how to deploy scarce resources e.g. extension support  services.       major constraints are:  \\uf0a7  disjointed and non-accessible information for planning, decision making and  innovation   \\uf0a7  limited awareness and capacity to manage information and knowledge at federal,  state and local level  \\uf0a7  poor ict infrastructure to serve many stakeholders   \\uf0a7  poor information exchange and delivery mechanism for farmers, research, private  sector, policy makers   \\uf0a7  ineffective research to extension delivery system i.e. limited commercialization of  knowledge created  policy thrust    \\uf0b7  policy to enhance availability of information and knowledge for farmers, agribusiness and  policymakers through implementation of an ict/km framework by   \\uf0b7  developing agricultural information systems; standards and institutional mechanisms  for content generation, policy support, stakeholder dialogue, innovation and learning  \\uf0b7  focus on disseminating information designed to help farmers make best choices  with respect to input costs, equipment leases, agronomic practices, crop prices,  and weather  \\uf0b7  experimenting with new devices to enhance ict/km capacity in the sector   \\uf0b7  reviving regional farm radio broadcasts designed to provide farming communities  with timely advice on planting, weeding, harvesting and key prices  \\uf0b7  promoting the emergence of specialized agricultural information and knowledge from  targeted research to address farmer priorities  \\uf0b7  enhancing reach, effectiveness and efficiency of the extension delivery system  (through use of various methods e.g. more extension workers and electronic  extension services via sms)      4.1.4. access to inputs (seeds/ seedlings, fertilizer, livestock/ fish feeds etc.)    access to inputs remains a challenge for achieving optimal productivity of agricultural outcomes.  attempts to address this issue in the previous government administration have resulted in subsidy  programmes (e.g. ges) which have been characterized by late or non-delivery of inputs.  other  problems encountered include delivery of sub-standard or counterfeit inputs, and exclusion of rightful  beneficiaries.  therefore, the policy objective is to increase productivity by ensuring access to timely,  high quality and price competitive inputs.    4.1.4.1.  (tree) crop production    background/ constraints     overall national availability of improved seed is an area of attention for enhancing productivity.  nigeria has a number of domestic and foreign seed companies whose activities partially rely on the          18 | p a g e     availability of seeds from the nigerian research system.  for example, oil palm seedlings rely on supply  from nifor, the oil palm research institute in benin city.  insufficient production of seedlings remains  a challenge especially those that can mature faster e.g. cocoa and oil palm.  this challenge is in turn  worsened by a lack of fertilizer. while domestic companies such as indorama and notore produce  fertilizer, about 40% - 60% of the volume used domestically is imported.  the dangote petrochemical  plant targeted for commencement in 2018 is expected to help solve these challenges.    major constraints are:  \\uf0a7  rapid commercialization of r&d findings into certified seeds  \\uf0a7  lack of access to sufficient and good quality inputs   \\uf0a7  ill-timed delivery of inputs  \\uf0a7  unreliable distribution and agro-dealer network  \\uf0a7  unsustainable budget commitment to the ges programme due to non-targeted distribution  of subsidies  \\uf0a7  deficient farmer identification mechanisms for subsidized inputs i.e. insufficient means  testing  \\uf0a7  government interference in the development of private-sector input production and supply  companies    \\uf0a7  low level of commercialization, access to information/knowledge  \\uf0a7  tenure issues in long term land ownership/lease    policy thrust    \\uf0b7  policy to ensure the availability of timely and high quality inputs by   -  stimulating domestic production of good quality inputs, especially seeds and fertilizer,  by paying attention to early generation of foundation seeds and speeding up the  certification process  -  improving the functioning of the seed council  -  financing for small seed companies as well as engaging with larger seed companies  to buy down risks of small holder farmers markets e.g. nirsal plc’s rice seed financing  proposal  -  engaging standards and quality control mechanisms at various points in the relevant  supply chains (e.g. existing fertilizer testing centres)  -  rechanneling subsidy programmes to ensure accountability, monitoring and  evaluation  \\uf0b7  policy to drive emergence of a dense private sector agro-dealer network with capacity to also  support near farm storage  \\uf0b7  policy to encourage effective fertilizer use (see soil mapping in policy thrust for soil fertility)  \\uf0b7  policy to encourage:  o amendment of current land use act (see policy thrust for access to land)   o access to market information on markets and innovations (see policy thrust for access  to information and knowledge  o development of processing and storage facilities (see policy thrust on storage)  \\uf0a7  review and facilitate the passage of pending fertliser and seed bills in the national assembly        4.1.4.2.  animal production incl. apiculture     background/ constraints           19 | p a g e     nigeria has made significant progress in in the production of animal protein.  based on baseline work  conducted by the in the early 1990s, it is estimated that nigeria has 13 million cattle, 35 million goats,  22 million sheep and 80 – 120 million chickens.  this has helped transform nigeria’s poultry industry  into one of africa’s largest.  today, nigeria has two broad challenges with livestock.  first, the country  lacks updated census data based on physical surveys and aerial overflights (systematic reconnaissance  flights).  second, within specific animal categories e.g. special challenges remain that are not being  addressed.  for example, the rapid growth in commercial poultry has created its own difficulties that  do need to be addressed with respect to waste disposal.      third, the cattle value chain has become a security problem.  today, the cattle value chain relies on a  network of nomadic herdsmen with cattle entering a brief fattening system before slaughter and  processing.  that supply chain however is both inefficient and a high security risk as roaming cattle  increasingly is a source of friction between land owners and herdsmen.  in order to protect all parties,  a key shift is necessary i.e. retain cattle in ranches.  thus, what is required is for the creation of a more  formal ranching system that will use better processes and inputs to extract higher value from in the  form of dairy, meat, and leather.  the less lean meats will in principle provide a wider range of options  for sellers, as well as. nigeria will actively support investors seeking to set-up modern ranches to raise  livestock rather than infringe on the property rights of land owners and users.    main constraints are:  \\uf0a7  limited knowledge of the nigeria’s livestock assets by size and location  \\uf0a7  conflicts with nomadic pastoral/transhumance system due to feed and fodder insecurity  \\uf0a7  low productive breeds of livestock  \\uf0a7  income loss and human health effects due to pest and disease  \\uf0a7  low incomes to limited access to markets hinged on lack of quality and standards as well as  poor transport infrastructure   \\uf0a7  low income from apiculture due to low productivity of honeybees, and low demand from  farmers due to lack of knowledge of the benefits of pollination for (tree)crops      policy thrust    \\uf0a7  policy to conduct regular, methodology driven livestock surveys and census in order to drive  evidence based decision making  \\uf0a7  policy to enhance availability of improved breeds, access to finance and information about  improved production methods, markets and prices  \\uf0a7  policy to enhance resistance breeding; promote availably of pest and disease control services,  and enhance livestock identification and traceability; zoning and compartmentalization of  livestock; disease surveillance system; quarantine services; facilitation of nationwide livestock  census  \\uf0a7  policies to incentivize set-up of modern ranching, abattoir and processing system  \\uf0a7  policy to stimulate beekeeping by raising awareness about benefits of beekeeping e.g. via  dedicated fmard and state adp experts working with farmers to install and monitor top-bar  hives; use of radio and tv campaign, school programs, etc. would be a backup awareness  building process.    4.1.4.3.  fish and aquaculture systems    background/ constraints             20 | p a g e     this sector caters for small, medium and large scale marine and fresh water fishing, including  aquaculture, with its distinctive constraints.  nigeria has built a large domestic fishery economy but  still relies heavily on imported fish and specialized feed for its protein consumption.  data from  customs indicate that nigeria imports between $400 and $600 million worth of fish and fish products  each year, creating an opportunity for further gains by domestic market participants.    main constraints are:  \\uf0a7  low productive fish breeds in aquaculture   \\uf0a7  low production due to lack of inputs (e.g. fingerlings, feed)  \\uf0a7  poor water quality (e.g. pollution)  \\uf0a7  security constraints in fisheries areas  \\uf0a7  low yields due to overfishing      policy thrust    \\uf0a7  policy to enhance fish breeding; promote availability of pest and disease control services, and  enhance traceability  \\uf0a7  policy to make fishery/aquaculture inputs available by promoting hatchery development,  standardization of hatchery and fish breeding processes  \\uf0a7  policy to reduce insecurity in fisheries areas  \\uf0a7  policy to re-inforce the regulatory framework for fishing activities      4.1.5. production management     4.1.5.1.  water/ irrigation systems    background/ constraints     water is a relative scarce commodity for production and hence requires attention. increased  productivity of crops will require a prudent use of additional water through irrigation.  optimizing the  use of available water resources is important and can be achieved by the choice of crops with limited  water requirement, use of water conservation techniques as well as efficient irrigation methods.   intensification of crop production, combined with effects of climate change such as desertification  and increased evaporation, result in surface water reduction.  further along the value chain, water is  essential for processing and hence requires ample attention. the quantity and the quality (clean  water) are important factors for food processing and human health.  at present, nigeria uses a system  built around river basin authorities to allocate water in specified tracts of the country. unfortunately,  that system is yet to provide the right level of water supply across the country; it still has great  potential if appropriate investments are made in irrigation systems as has been the case recently in  the hadejia river basin authority.    major constraints are:  \\uf0b7  under-utilization of large dams due to decline in water dispersion systems e.g. pipes, pump  stations and related supporting infrastructure  \\uf0b7  insufficient water for full year agricultural production  \\uf0b7  insufficient investment in irrigation systems and equipment whether drip or otherwise   \\uf0b7  reducing water availability and increasing drought due to climate change and deforestation  \\uf0b7  substandard quality of water (e.g. due to overuse of agrochemicals and dumping of wastes)          21 | p a g e     policy thrust    policy to promote optimize use of water for agricultural production through:  \\uf0b7  revitalizing existing, and development of new, small (earth) dams, tube wells and wash bores.  \\uf0b7  facilitating optimization of the utilization of existing large dams for irrigation.  \\uf0b7  private sector investment in irrigation and irrigation systems, including fee for service  providers  \\uf0b7  promoting water conservation by harvesting run-off water and reducing desertification by  tree planting etc.  \\uf0b7  revitalizing the river basin authorities and transforming their role in water availability and  pricing    4.1.5.2.  pest & disease    background/ constraints     pest and disease control is critical for incomes in the crops (including tree crop), livestock and fisheries  subsectors and important for human health.  in specialized systems with a limited genetic base, rapid  spread of pests and diseases can occur and attention is required for preventive as well as curative  measures. pesticide overuse may occur during the production or storage process which affects food  quality and human health.  overuse has spill-over effects on soil and water bodies with indirect effects  on human health. fmard in addition to promoting safe use of pesticides and other crop protection  chemicals intends to also explore integrated pest management control programmes, as well as  explore the use of organic control mechanisms.    major constraints:  \\uf0b7  indiscriminate use of agricultural inputs such as fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides, and  veterinary medicines, often leads to contamination of food with chemical hazards;  \\uf0b7  poor disease containment and control mechanisms    policy thrust    policy for safe use of agro-chemicals and pesticides by:  \\uf0b7  enhancing regulation, inspection and enforcement of safe use of agrochemicals  \\uf0b7  enhancing access to information about safe use of agrochemicals  \\uf0b7  quality assurance and testing for residues  \\uf0b7  promoting safe alternatives where available e.g. organic pesticides  \\uf0b7  integrated pest management and control mechanisms  \\uf0b7  facilitate inter-ministerial co-ordination for disease control    4.1.5.3.  mechanization    background/ constraints     mechanization of the various steps in the production system for various value systems and  commodities is required to enhance productivity and scale up production of the agricultural sector.  it  has an investment component, which requires review of the modalities of ownership and use for  small, medium and large-scale producers.  based on estimates developed by fmard, nirsal and  propcom/dfid, nigeria needs to add over 100,000 - 120,000 tractors and related equipment over the  coming 5 to 8 years in order to achieve its production target.  production, maintenance and access to          22 | p a g e     effective equipment are other aspects that require attention.  fmard intends to work with private  sector partners to expand supply of spare parts, ensure compliance with scheduled maintenance, and  train mechanics, in addition to boosting the network of entrepreneurial service centers.    major constraints are:  \\uf0b7  insufficient network of entrepreneurial service centers to provide fee for service  mechanization  \\uf0b7  homogenous selection of technology   \\uf0b7  lack of access to machines, equipment and spare parts at affordable rates  \\uf0b7  underdevelopment and poor funding of mechanization research and development   \\uf0b7  poor resource base and poor technical skills leading to low patronage of fabricators  \\uf0b7  pool of trained mechanics and technicians to support equipment maintenance    policy thrust    policy to promote information, finance and availability of relevant equipment along the value chain of  key commodities by:   \\uf0b7  promoting private-sector-led mechanization services as well as cooperative solutions for  private sector-led tractor hiring system  \\uf0b7  stimulating domestic production of equipment linked with complementary targeted import  and standardization of agro-technology       4.1.6. storage    background/ constraints    given the current post-harvest loss rates of up to 60% for perishable crops, nigeria needs to rapidly  introduce new storage solutions across its agricultural system. at the national level, nigeria has  recently invested ₦66 billion to establish 33 silo complexes, 25 grain aggregation centres, and 9 units  of blumberg warehouses, which have now been privatized by way of concession.  the project, which  is at varying degrees of completion or deliverables, aims to keep 5% of national output in storage.  in  addition, if successful, the project will help sustain national food security in terms of food price  stabilization, market and macroeconomic stability.  it also aims at delivering food in periods of national  disaster as well as food aid to regional markets.     constraints:  \\uf0b7  finance is critical to storage; for instance, farmers who need cash quickly are reluctant to  store. they thus sell products at the point when poor pricing prevails.    \\uf0b7  poor management of storage facilities, including silos   \\uf0b7  poor food quality, with pesticide residues, moulds and aflatoxin  \\uf0b7  health effects due to unsafe use of pesticide and agrochemicals (inter-ministerial approach);  \\uf0b7  post-harvest losses due to rodents and pests  \\uf0b7  fluctuating and non-accessibility of affordable food during times of emergency, drought etc.  \\uf0b7  underproduction that leads to undersupply of grain and pulses in the market, tightening  government competition with private sector buyers while filling the national reserve.                  23 | p a g e     policy thrust    \\uf0b7  crowd in private investments into the sector to deepen overall logistics and infrastructure  footprint, creating options for farmers and other value chain actors  \\uf0b7  policy to enhance finance, information and availability of proper methods for safe and effective  storage (blumberg large scale; local storage solutions etc.)  \\uf0b7  policy to facilitate public-private partnerships to rapidly expand storage and related logistics  support infrastructure   \\uf0b7  policy to improve access to finance and information to expand use of safe and effective small,  medium scale storage facilitate by targeting research (e.g. on irradiation) and stimulating private  sector solutions; ensuring testing and quality control on agrochemical residues and aflatoxin  \\uf0b7  policy to enhance information about good agricultural practices (gap) and innovative methods  of storage at community, state or federal level, on safe and responsible use of agrochemicals  \\uf0b7  policy to ensure that government maintains a safe storage that can guarantee national food  security for a minimum of 1 year; review silos project and other forms of storage to ensure these  will meet the goal of 5% grain in storage better and faster  \\uf0b7  policy to enforce standards in quality of storage facilities:  \\uf0a7  enforcement of minimum moisture content for stored food  \\uf0a7  promotion of the use of alternative pest control in storage      4.1.7. processing    background/ constraints:    in nigeria today, there are broadly two types of food processing: cottage level and industrial  processing. due to insufficient food inspection and standards enforcement, food processing often  involves output of uneven quality especially at the cottage level.  the challenge sometimes emerges  from a lack of standards or when these are present, insufficient enforcement or a lack of enabling  systems.  for example, while not a case of food processing, the processing of cotton suffers from a  clear, industry wide standardization system.  as a result, contaminants in cotton e.g. plastic threads in  the cotton reduce the grading awarded and therefore the cash returns attributable to the farmer.  for  crops with export market potential, that imposes a quality penalty as well e.g. recent restrictions on  nigerian beans exports to the european union due to the presence of contaminants.  rectification of  the challenge will require changes to processing standards, training, equipment, and inspection  protocols.  such a preventive strategy alongside other investment decisions such as improvements to  local infrastructure (roads, power, water, land), will improve economic outcomes for sector  participants.    constraints are:   \\uf0a7  inadequate infrastructure provision around high agricultural produce areas  \\uf0a7  lack of extension services and poor capacity for post-harvest handling  \\uf0a7  lack of quality standards for produce inspection, grading, food safety and traceability,  customized to nigerian conditions for both large and small-scale growers  \\uf0a7  cultural restrictions to modern processing practices and technology (e.g. in the sub-sector of  livestock processing/ abattoirs)  \\uf0a7  lack of efficient coordinated government efforts to monitor the inflow of agricultural produce  at the land borders, seaport and airports and to follow developments in the international  trade arena closely to the benefit of market actors in nigerian agriculture           24 | p a g e     \\uf0a7  improper linkage between upstream farm practices e.g. pesticide/fertilizer use, and  downstream food quality requirements in domestic and export markets    policy thrust     fmard will promote policies to:  \\uf0a7  crowd in private investments into the sector to deepen value addition and reduce waste  \\uf0a7  enhance access to finance and information about innovative processing methods  \\uf0a7  facilitate out-grower schemes to secure supply of quality inputs from high production areas  and improving access to value chain finance   \\uf0a7  enforce quality standards, food safety for markets that ensure emergence of modernized, safe  processing zones.  \\uf0a7  enhance capacity of the naqs of fmard and produce inspection department of fmiti as well  foster policy synergy between fmard and fmiti on agricultural commodity trade.  \\uf0a7  intensify awareness of public and farmer understanding of food safety protocols        4.1.8. marketing & trade    background/ constraints    marketing and trade in agriculture have common constraints across rural markets as well as those  serving larger urban markets, but there are also differential impacts.  consumption by nigeria’s  growing population (~180 million) requires foresight in terms of the types of food demanded and  therefore the implications for production, processing, marketing, and trade. these implications are  relatively well known (models of demography, geo-located, with clear understanding of how food  preferences shift with increased income or urbanization). in general, this roadmap focuses more on  the production side, and does not include the derivative needs of a rapidly growing urban market for  food.  market access issues will be dealt with in partnership with private sector actors. finally, nigeria  has not exploited global markets for its key foods e.g. cassava for a variety of reasons including quality,  market knowledge and financing issues.  while tariff regimes are an issue, the bigger barrier is  overcoming the phytosanitary requirements set by importing countries. in order to do that, the entire  value chain of stakeholders need to be involved in preparing crops for export.      major constraints are:   \\uf0a7  infrastructure (road, power, farmer data, etc.)  \\uf0a7  lack of quality market information to enable identification of market opportunities,  coordination among market actors and transparency  \\uf0a7  inadequate linkage within multiple agricultural supply chains  \\uf0a7  lack of coordination of efforts to improve efficiency between concerned government agencies  \\uf0a7  marketing constraints due to poor infrastructure and transportation (roads, railways etc.)  \\uf0a7  limited awareness and understanding of key export markets e.g. us, uk and eu  \\uf0a7  poor understanding of the lifecycle of contamination of crops from early stage soil preparation  to post-harvest handling    policy thrust    policy to enhance access to domestic and international

the  agribusiness value chain. the target outcome is a lower cost of financing and a greater availability of  such financing as measured by cost of capital (%) paid, number of loans issued versus overall credit  provision, levels of private capital formation, and the number of participants in the sector.  note  that while they are not explicitly listed here, there are a number of app priorities for which crowding  in of private investment is a key goal. these include storage, processing, marketing & trade, and  infrastructure.  while fmard will continue to make selective interventions in these areas,  encouraging private capital to take the lead on driving projects into these spaces is a key shift.       4.2.1. access to finance    background    agricultural finance is critical for producers of all sizes (from smallholder farmers, medium size farmer  and larger commercial farms) as well as to properly-functioning input supply markets, processors and  traders.  beyond the access to capital – defined as volume and price of capital, a related issue includes  competition.  it is vital that finance and risk management tools be available from multiple sources  (channels), other than the conventional banking system; examples are public capital markets, private  equity and other non-bank channels.  however, the current policy efforts to mitigate these issues  while partially successful (e.g. raising lending from 1% in 2011 to ~6% in 2015) can do even more.   based on prior discussions between cbn, the bankers committee, fmard and nirsal plc, a 10% of  all formal credit provided should go to agriculture by 2017 – 2018.  access to insurance contracts also  remains a challenge. while new providers have been licensed by the insurance commission to retail  agricultural insurance (e.g. igi), naic remains the dominant supplier.  however agricultural insurance  penetration remains below 3% (measured by farmers enrolled and cropping area covered) versus 10%  target (using india and china as proxies) which would be a reasonable target by 2021.    constraints     \\uf0a7  insufficient access to credit and insurance products  \\uf0a7  inadequate mechanism

sector as  an engine to drive growth of agricultural sector. this has required the development of some effective  institutional frameworks to facilitate and coordinate the delivery of agribusiness and investment  services.    the post-harvest handling of agricultural produce is an important component of value chain  development, and a catalyst for progressive and sustainable expansion of agribusiness, investment  and agro-processing activities, thereby eradicating waste and ensuring import substitution, food  security, wealth creation, employment generation, human capital development and security of human  life and property.            27 | p a g e     lack of government coordination (100%), inconsistencies in policy, regulatory, laws, taxes and  administrative practices (94%), lack of security of raw material supplies to food processors (75%), lack  of human capital (50%), were identified as top constraints facing agribusiness investors in nigeria from  two recent surveys commissioned by fmard in 2013.    major constraints:  •         absence of appropriate and adaptive processing technology at small scale level  •         absence of rural infrastructure to support rural primary processing  •         inadequate capacity for processing or crude processing methods  •         lack of quality control and standard  •         low private sector investment in agriculture/agro-processing  •         absence of low cost, market-oriented research prototyping  •         inaccessibility and high cost of fund for agro-processing  •         low level of capacity of local fabricators  •          poor quality of information and irregular dissemination impedes investors’ abilities to  properly plan investments  •         no single point of contact: investors do not know how to find available services and are  compelled to interact with resources across multiple mdas to achieve their objectives  •  ill-timed service delivery: delivery of government service are frequently delayed,  while contracts and mous with mdas and state governments can go unfulfilled     policy thrust  \\uf0b7  promotion of access to agro-processing through both public intervention and facilitation  of private sector investment.  \\uf0b7  revitalization of staple crops processing zones, agribusiness incubation centres and  agro-industrial parks  \\uf0b7  partnership with state governments to incentivize agribusiness-development including  safeguards for small holders, rapid collateralization of land, and focused infrastructure  access  o provision of rural infrastructure, roads, water, electricity and others   \\uf0b7  harmonization of standards, quality and other food safety measures for food security,  market and trade  \\uf0b7  facilitation of provision of modern paddy handling equipment in key clusters  \\uf0b7  establishment of price discovery mechanisms and selective use of supports  \\uf0b7  establishment and leverage in a consultative capacity of a national agribusiness  consultative and advisory forum.        4.3.  theme 3: fmard’s institutional realignment    the discussions which follow are designed to deepen the capacity of the ministry and its key partners  to regulate the sector, engage previously excluded stakeholders, lead policy dialogue and broker the  necessary agreements to improve the ease of doing business in nigeria’s agriculture space. the target  outcome is a more engaged agribusiness market space and ecosystem as measured by ease of doing  business in the sector.                   28 | p a g e     4.3.1. institutional setting and roles (federal vs. state government vs. local governments)    though the two tiers of government – federal and state – have authority over agriculture,  collaboration has not always been smooth, nor desirable results generated.  therefore, in order to  ensure full potential henceforth, both parties have to focus on greater collaboration, implementing  policies jointly approved at the national council on agriculture.  both parties have to set-up  mechanisms to remove conflict and focus squarely on implementation.  beyond the obvious, at the  farm level, delivering results is truly about local government areas (lgas).  lgas are truly the field  operators with whom investors often deal with, and therefore cannot be a footnote in economic  reform discussions. important that algon be consulted and actively engaged to improve operational  effectiveness of agriculture.    constraint:  \\uf0b7  apathy in states for key programmes driven by federal government  \\uf0b7  history of non-involvement of lgas in policy execution due to implicit control issues between  states and lgas  \\uf0b7  disturbance by government intervention of market processes and hampering development of  the private sector   \\uf0b7  scattered, incompatible or inefficient policy processes and programmes of the various  stakeholders at federal and state levels      policy thrust    \\uf0b7  identify ways of boosting cooperation and accountability at the state level to ensure reform  is carried out consistently  \\uf0b7  create explicit partnership with lgas with a focus on operational and investment execution  issues from infrastructure to community relations to access to high quality talent  \\uf0b7  leverage improved federal-state dialogue to engage other investors and improve levels of  communication in the agribusiness economy further        4.3.2. youth and women    the joint issue here is the need to maximize the contributions of women and youth to agricultural  production and elimination of discriminatory practices in the employment of women and youth in the  sector.  in a number of cases such discrimination is explicit (e.g. via cultural inheritance practices), or  inadvertent.  a key goal of policy should be to shift behaviors that result in negative outcomes for  youth and women, and reinforce such shifts by expanding wealth creation opportunities for youths  and women.    constraints:  \\uf0b7  poor enforcement of gender based policies, as well as institutional bias  \\uf0b7  lack of capacity and employment opportunities for internship and mentoring  \\uf0b7  limited access to finance  \\uf0b7  lack of mechanization serves as disincentive to women and youths  \\uf0b7  lack of synergy between and among mdas and other non-state actors in respect of  implementation of women and youth programmes            29 | p a g e     policy thrust  \\uf0b7  develop and launch entrepreneurship platforms that create a pathway for youth and women  to enter agribusiness economy  o expand cooperation with cbn’s intervention funds targeted at women and youth  e.g. msme  o facilitate investment advisory support for potential entrepreneurs   \\uf0b7  review the subsisting gender policy document with a view to improving the implementation  activities  \\uf0b7  expand training of key leaders and influencers across fmard to ensure gender / youth  considerations integrated into decision making   \\uf0b7  expand capacity building for women and youth for entrepreneurship, including technical  training and access to financial services  \\uf0b7  facilitate dialogue with farmer groups and service providers (for women and youth) to expand  pool of ideas fmard can pursue to institutionalize change      4.3.3. infrastructure    the policy recognition for rural development relates to the need, as a responsibility of the  government, to reduce poverty in rural areas, alleviating the suffering of rural dwellers and creating  enablers for economic take-off in the rural areas. these will be achieved through the systematic  provision of individual infrastructural facilities and also through the integrated approach to rural  development.    constraints:  \\uf0b7  high mobility of rural population to the urban area in search of better life  \\uf0b7  implicit urban-biased of development policy authorities that ignore the rural areas  \\uf0b7  sluggish growth and development of rural economy to support rural development efforts  \\uf0b7  poor state of rural infrastructure to attract investment in rural areas  \\uf0b7  absence of database for rural infrastructure planning and perpetual reliance of government  on old database    policy thrust  \\uf0b7  government will ensure that all stakeholders play their roles in the provision of rural  infrastructure.  \\uf0b7  as approved by nca already, government will resuscitate and review the rural  infrastructure survey project of fmard, with a view re-establishing the old database  for rural infrastructure planning;   \\uf0b7  aggressive promotion of rural infrastructure buildup will be embarked upon  \\uf0b7  economic activities will be promoted in rural areas.   \\uf0b7  aggressive promotion of rural infrastructure will be undertaken  \\uf0b7  improve the enabling environment for investment opportunities         4.3.4. climate smart agriculture    the notion of climate smart agriculture was sponsored by fao, as an approach to developing the  technical, policy and investment conditions to achieve sustainable agricultural development for food  security under climate change. this entails (i) sustainably increasing agricultural productivity and          30 | p a g e     incomes; (ii) adapting and building resilience to climate change; and (iii) reducing and/or removing  greenhouse gases emissions, where possible.  at the cop21 summit, nigeria presented its preexisting  position on climate smart agriculture, the nigeria agriculture resilience framework (narf). narf has  not been implemented and that will be a key focus area going forward.    constraint:  \\uf0b7  limited awareness of climate issues, and therefore key changes required to protect  agriculture  \\uf0b7  poor management of land, water, soil nutrients and genetic resources;  \\uf0b7  inconsistency of the governance regimes, policies, legislations and financial mechanisms with  the requirements for climate friendly agricultural practices  \\uf0b7  inefficient and unsustainable management of agriculture and natural resources e.g. soil,  water, etc.  \\uf0b7  lack of awareness of soil management practices  \\uf0b7  limited availability of drought resistant variety of crops  \\uf0b7  lack of research into climate smart agriculture  \\uf0b7  lack of cooperation and synergy among the key mdas and other stakeholders  \\uf0b7  absence of comprehensive soil map for nigeria  \\uf0b7  lack of awareness on climate change and its effects on agricultural practices  \\uf0b7  lack of access to alternative energy use  \\uf0b7  poor infrastructure to support climate smart agriculture    policy thrust    \\uf0b7  boosting public awareness through advertising of importance of climate smart agriculture  \\uf0b7  the management of land, water, soil and other natural resources will be improved  \\uf0b7  institutional linkages and partnerships will be strengthened for ensuring climate smart  agricultural governance, policies, legislations and financial mechanisms  \\uf0b7  environmental impact assessment will be carried out on major agricultural projects  \\uf0b7  the use of renewable energy will be promoted with the involvement of private sector  \\uf0b7  broad public and stakeholder awareness on climate smart agriculture will be created  \\uf0b7  government will facilitate soil map to improve land use and management practices  \\uf0b7  government will increase the adoption of global best practices on climate change, including  the aspects of adaptation, mitigation and carbon credit       4.3.5. research & innovation    agricultural research is recognized as a critical enabler of economic growth. it is therefore prioritized  by the constitution and explicitly assigned as the primary responsibility of the federal government on  the concurrent legislative list. thus, the importance of agricultural research on the policy agenda of  the federal government, towards national food security, import substitution and job creation cannot  be overemphasized.  to this end, the federal government will engage its institutions and bodies at  different locations in the country, to conduct research for increased agricultural productivity and to  make the research results available to farmers and other actors in the agricultural development of the  states.     in this regard, institutions and organizations owned by the federal government that make up the  national agricultural research system (nars) comprise 15 commodity-based research institutes, 11          31 | p a g e     federal colleges of agriculture, a specialized national agricultural extension institute, over 50  faculties of agriculture in regular federal universities; and 3 specialized universities of agriculture.  the activities of these institutions come under the purview of agricultural research council of nigeria  (arcn), which oversees their operations.  in addition, nigeria hosts a number of relevant international  research institutions e.g. the international agricultural research centre (iarc), and the international  institute of tropical agriculture (iita).   however, despite the existing institutional capacity, the nars  has not been able to engineer a significant and sustainable agricultural growth that would ensure  national and household food security, create wealth and employment and make nigeria a competitor  in the global food markets.  part of that is the result of a weak mechanism for translating research into  field usage. the well documented weaknesses in the extension system as well as a failure to properly  incentivize innovation at the inventor level are contributing factors.     going forward, nigerian agricultural research also has to contend with the need to become climate  smart. that shift will require different research priorities, development of new varieties, and a more  rapid co-creation cycle with industry and operators.       constraints:  \\uf0b7 poor and irregular funding for agricultural research and extension,  \\uf0b7 research outputs not demand-driven  \\uf0b7 the research-extension linkage system is weak; so the technologies or innovations generated  are not effectively delivered to farmers or commercialized for the benefit of end users.   \\uf0b7 departure in the programmes of the universities of agriculture from their statutory mandate in  relation to the programmes of fmard     policy thrust    policies that will drive improvements here include:  \\uf0b7  incentives for nars to improve its ability to attract talent, maintain productive partnerships  (domestic and foreign)  \\uf0b7  expand research community’s capacity to leverage digital innovations to lower costs of field  work  \\uf0b7  incentivize narss to engage with farmers more broadly and at lower price point / cost as a  step for ultimately improving extension services to farmers.   \\uf0b7  reform and reposition the arcn to strengthen it for more effective delivery of its mandate  activities, with particular emphasis on the following aspects:  o review process for granting intellectual property and upside to researchers at arcn  institutions  o encourage set-up of start-ups and venture companies to license and commercialize  existing and future intellectual property emerging from the arcn  \\uf0b7  empower and strengthen arcn to set and drive the national intellectual agenda for  agricultural research;  o resuscitate the competitive agricultural research grant scheme;   o reactivate the process of establishment of the center for crop and animal  improvement for training of breeders;   o pursue, vigorously, the establishment of spin-off companies in research institutes &  colleges;  o support fmard in negotiations with the world bank towards securing funding for  waapp-2 nigeria that is expected to commence in 2017;           32 | p a g e     o strengthen existing adopted villages, agricultural research outreach centers (aroc)  and agricultural research technology transfer centres (arttc) and the  establishment of new ones.   o establish select commercial farms to demonstrate research results in managing large- scale agriculture.      4.3.6. food, consumption and nutrition security    background/ constraints    food consumption is closely linked to nutrition.  adequate food is required of the right composition  and quality for sustaining good health.  food can be obtained from personal production or purchased  on the market.  the quality of food relates to the composition of macro and micronutrients as well as  safety aspects, e.g. residues of agrochemicals. furthermore, diseases and other factors determine the  nutritional quality and status of food.  intake of micronutrients can be enhanced by fortification, either  by direct addition post-harvest or systemically through breeding.  as nigeria’s work and eating habits  evolve, a striking rise in levels of obesity and diabetes is emerging in urban areas; co-morbidities  including kidney disease and cardiac complications are also emerging. it is critical that in the short to  medium term, government intensify its work to help evolve eating habits in nigeria towards a more  balanced regimen in order to reduce overconsumption of certain classes of foods e.g. carbohydrates.    major constraints:  \\uf0b7  low income resulting in low purchasing power for adequate food  \\uf0b7  lack of access to nutritious foods  \\uf0b7  lack of awareness about proper nutrition and importance of balanced diets e.g. food pyramid  \\uf0b7  poor quality of food due to contamination with agrochemicals (pesticide), bio-chemicals (e.g.  aflatoxins), or pests and diseases.        policy thrust    \\uf0b7  policy to ensure national food security by  o expanding strategic food reserves to make food available at short notice during periods  of unexpected scarcity and for stabilizing food prices  o provide food during periods of emergency due to civil strife or natural disasters  \\uf0b7  policy to make nutritious foods available at local level through school feeding programmes, and  fortification of foods through breeding and at post-harvest handling  \\uf0b7 policy to raise awareness about nutritious foods including publishing of the food pyramid in schools  and via social media to improve awareness about balance (see discussions on access to  information & knowledge)  \\uf0b7 policy to enhance the quality of foods by proper use of agrochemicals, quality control and testing  (see chapter on pest & disease)  \\uf0b7 policies to encourage continued expansion of organic farming and sale of the freshest foods  domestically and internationally  \\uf0b7 policies to create a standard system for food safety inspections, origin tracking and nutrition  labeling e.g. caloric content   \\uf0b7 policies to encourage tighter linkages in the supply chain policies of supermarkets and regional  farm centres             33 | p a g e     8. next steps: prioritization, costing and implementation    a preliminary prioritization of the policy priorities is presented below. in summary, fmard’s strategy  is to initially prioritize investing in systems and markets, and then shift focus to boosting productivity  so that farmers and other investors can earn the highest possible return on their increased output.      note that while activity will occur across the 16 key areas, what will be different will be the intensity  of activity.  for example, improvements to input productivity will have a lighter touch in 2016 – 2017,  while emphasis on improving market access and storage will have a heavier touch in the same planning  period. that way, existing gains in productivity will have commercial outlets, setting up the right  context for further productivity gains in 2017 – 2018.      table 4: preliminary prioritization and timelines for app implementation  thematic  category  policy themes  2h  2016  1h  2017  2h  2017  1h  2018  2h  2018  1h  2019  2h  2020

analysis on the decision process, cost and administrative impact of  each policy  a. action item required to implement the proposed reform in terms of decision i.e.  executive action, or legislative action e.g. proclamation in official gazette  b. anticipated cost of implementing the decision e.g. capital expenditure, personnel  cost, or administrative costs, and over what time frame e.g. cost of opening cattle  ranches by the private sector  c. key administrative systems that will be impacted by decision e.g. impact on federal  extension department of adding 15,000 new extension workers    2. create an implementation plan and timeline for the policy  a. what should be done in 2016 versus 2017?  b. what are the key dependencies in the system to ensure full impact from related  policies e.g. impact of financial access on storage    3. convene key stakeholders to share emerging cost, decision and implementation plan  a. integrate feedback and refine policy prioritization as appropriate  b. commence implementation of the app    4. set up a dedicated implementation support team that will act as an analytical engine as well  as project management office for tracking the app  a. staff team with primarily mix of senior and junior civil servants, with some outside  technical and commercial advisory support  b. assign responsibilities for executing the app across key departments and agencies of  the ministry; where appropriate e.g. coordination with state governments and other  federal mdas, create a cross-departmental and agency team  c. commence execution of the policy and on a quarterly basis, review progress against  plan; when necessary course correct as needed  d. periodically publish progress updates on key parameters within the ministry and  share with other 3rd party stakeholders    fmard anticipates that by august 30, 2016, all the above steps would be completed, and the first  progress review session will occur on october 2, 2016.                35 | p a g e       9. appendix: policy matrix summary    the tables below summarize the key policy choices encapsulated in the app.  the matrix is organized along the 3 thematic categories: boosting productivity,  intensifying role of private investors, and rebuilding the ministry’s capacity to conduct its core regulatory roles.      productivity enhancements   crowding in private sector investment   fmard

availability of such financing as measured by cost  of capital (%) paid, number of loans issued versus  overall credit provision, levels of private capital  formation, and the number of participants in the  sector.     target: the target outcome is a more engaged  agribusiness market space and ecosystem as  measured by ease of doing business in the  sector.                          36 | p a g e

(policy thrust 3); info on land  title procedures                            2. soil fertility           soil fertility is related to availability of  macro and micro nutrients for crops which  need to be replenished when harvesting and  removal of nutrients with crops. in addition,  soil fertility is related to the structure and  level or organic matter which determines  policy to maintain and enhance soil  fertility and promote soil erosion  control         refine ges support by expanding  access to soil tailored fertilizer  e.g. npk formula adapted to soil  fertility, crops and agro-

state  governments    13.  youth and  women  youth are an increasing portion of the  population with 70% of the population  under age 35.  it is important to grow  employment for this rapidly growing  segment of the population.   high mobility of rural population to the  urban area in search of better life weakens  the human resource base required for  dynamic and productive agricultural  production.  women are the main drivers of small and  medium scale agricultural production  though have less access to land, inputs and  agricultural services than men and hence  require special attention.     problems with youth and women in the  areas of employment in rural areas and  agriculture especially due to:  policy to foster full inclusion of  youth and women in the  agricultural sector.                                  policy reform to:    -  review the gender policy  document; implement  related activities by shifting  key behaviors at the  institutional level  -  promote a

connection) are as following:    1.  poor state of rural infrastructure to  attract investment in rural areas.    2.  urban-bias in development policy     3.  high costs of transport due to ‘taxes’,  poor road maintenance, scarcity of  transport in rural areas.    policy to ensure that all  stakeholders play their roles in the  provision of rural infrastructures.    policy to leverage existing inter- ministerial coordination to problem  solve in infrastructure           policy reform is to:    ad 1.  -  incentivize states and  private investors to expand  pool of rural infrastructure  e.g. irrigation, roads, gas,  ict  ad 2.  -  promote economic  activities in rural areas;  provide the enabling  programs to address:    ad 1, 3  -  setup a multi-stakeholder  mechanism to ensure that all

change  climate change effects relate to increasing  temperatures, more droughts/ erratic rains  effecting agricultural production patterns  options. low agricultural productivity and  production failures as a result of climate  change are due to:    1.  limited availability of varieties /breeds  adapted to higher temperatures,  drought-resistant, new diseases    2.  inefficient and unsustainable   practices to manage agriculture and  natural resources e.g. soil, water  genetic resources etc.     3.  limited synergy among the key mdas  and stakeholders (mdas, including  ministry of environment);  inconsistency of governance regimes,  policies, legislations and financial  mechanisms with the requirements for  climate friendly agricultural practices;     policy to mitigate effects of climate  change in agriculture and reduce its  negative   impact on environment                                             policy reform to:    -  implementation of the  nigeria

food,  consumption and  nutrition security  food security at national level is achieved by  a combination of domestic food production,  imports and strategic storage. shortages  may arise due to structural or incidental low  production (droughts, disasters) and in the  absence of sufficient forex and proper  infrastructure to import and distribute food  across the country.     food shortages (real or anticipated) drive up  prices and thereby jeopardize access to food  for urban and rural population.    at household level a similar combination of  own production, purchase from the market  and storage determine access to food and  nutritional security.    in addition to the quantity the quality of  food (macro/micro) nutrients are important.   nigeria’s food consumption needs to on  balance become healthier and mindful of  downstream implications e.g. diabetes due  to starch levels in an increasingly sedentary  population.  children and women of child- bearing age are particularly prone to the  effects of under-or malnutrition requiring  special attention.      problems and constraints in this area are  due to:    national food and food security    1.  low production that leads to under  supply of grains and pulses in the  market, resulting in government  competing with private off-takers for  filling the national reserve.  2.  inappropriate food storage facilities to  mitigate fluctuating production and  poor accessibility of food during times  of emergency, drought etc.  3.  limited forex to finance food imports  policy to ensure national food and  nutrition security by ensuring  adequate availability of safe and  nutritious food at affordable prices  for rural and urban population in  nigeria at national and household  level
