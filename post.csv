Not exactly in a rush but is this a good drive to replace it with or should I hold out for the P41 to drop again? it has always been $149. I know becuase its been in my cart for a few days. you fuckers sold it out Worth returning the Hynix P31 @ $145 for this instead? For a gaming drive. Unavailable nearby for me with Best Buy; however checked Microcenter and they also have this drive for $149.99. Bangin deal no? I got a 2tb m.2 from micro center not too long ago for $80, which was posted on this sub thanks to whoever posted it BH has the same deal and lists it expiring after December 24th Would this be sufficient for the PS5? This good for a boot drive? is this the drive that gets hot enough to warrant a heatsink? i’m assuming the motherboard ones are good enough That didn't last long. I bought the Hynix P41 for $179. Return it for this? Will this work with a 10900k & z590 mobo? If yes, how much difference will I notice compared to a 970 Evo nvme. How does this compare to Samsung 980 pro? MC has it for $199.99. Wouldn’t mind saving the $50 if there isn’t much of a difference Will this work in a gen3 pcie m.2 converter? Here's the P3 drive for $119.99 on sale through the 24th.

I had to RMA a Samsung Pro 850 which I bought new and Samsung required the receipt. I don't know if they will honor the warranty if it is refurbished. If anyone has experience and can comment I would appreciate it.  Also note that on my RMA I did not register the drive so there is a possibility that is why the receipt was required. I'm just speculating though. This for a One X? Or should I wait for a better deal on MX500.  Edit: The 2TB and larger versions of the QVO have a 78GB SLC cache provided you have 156GB free. After the cache is exhausted, write speeds drop from 560MB/s to 160MB/s. However that pretty much will only happen when you're moving several games to the console from external storage. Unless you have Gigabit internet, your internet is going to bottleneck you before the drive when downloading games.  Also it does have a DRAM cache.  I bought it, which means the MX500 2TB is about to go on sale for 90, you're welcome everyone. No.  Get yourself a new NVMe around this price point, either gen 3 or 4.  I will say that I have bought Samsung refurbished SSDs before and they're always like new, so zero concerns about it being refurbished However, it just doesn't make sense to buy this at this price.

Two variants of this drive exist, the original is a Phison E12 + 64L TLC, the slightly newer variant is a Phison E12S + 96L TLC, you could get either but both are fantastic. Both variants are essentially the same in performance for pretty much all intents and purposes.   The E12S is the same controller as the E12 but in a smaller package and typically using a smaller DRAM cache as well. This means most E12 variants are double sided (NAND chips on both sides of the M.2 stick), while most E12S are single-sided due to the smaller size, single sided should be preferred for laptops, mini PCs, enclosures, etc. due to less room, desktops it generally doesn't matter. Any performance lost with having less DRAM is more than made up for with the faster 96L NAND, but both the potneital loss from the DRAM and the potential gain from the NAND are maybe a few percent at best. Also, FWIW this is also the case with all Phison E12 drives as the original E12 controller was phased out in favor of the E12S as it's cheaper to produce, so drives like the Sabrent Rocket 3.0 and Team MP34 saw the same thing.

You may have more difficulties with Newegg or Walmart.   *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/buildapcsales) if you have any questions or concerns.* Oh, also since no one's pointed it out yet:   This is a Phison E18 + DRAM + 176L Micron B47R TLC drive. It is the best of the best right now, competing with the WD SN850X, Samsung 990 Pro, etc.   Nextorage was a joint venture between Sony and Phison to brand and sell drives for the PS5's expansion slot. It is now wholly owned by Phison and looks like it's going to be used as a way for Phison to sell the drives they already make direct to consumers. Phison previously has been manufacturing drives for others to sell under their own brand names, names many already know like Corsair, Sabrent, Kingston, Team, etc. That's not to say all drives sold by those companies are Phison drives, but many are. Since it's not a consumer-facing company, many probably do not know about Phison but they are a massive manufacturer with quality matching that of WD, Samsung, Crucial, etc. that design, manufacture, and sell their own drives, as said Phison just sells their drives to other brands instead of direct to consumers. I see no reason to be wary of Nextorage given they're a direct subsidiary of Phison. Comes with a heatsink. This has been on the same price for some time but I feel like it's one of the better SSD deals that are being posted around here. It's also got an A in the **[SSD tier list](https://linustechtips.com/topic/1092033-ssd-tier-list/)**. Definitely a good deal for this type of drive. Also if you don't want the heatsink, you can save $3 lol.   Looking into it further, the heatsink is not meant to be removed. HOWEVER, the [NAS Compares](https://nascompares.com/2022/01/26/nextorage-nem-pa-nvme-ssd-review-benchmark/) review of this drive did remove the heatsink themselves, so it is possible. Couple of notes:  1) this likely violates your warranty should you remove it. You could keep it around and reattach it should you ever need to return it, though the thermal pad will likely harden and there is thermal gel/paste that will certainly dry. You could hope they don't notice/don't care/don't disassemble, but anyone who knows anything about this stuff could pretty easily tell if they did disassemble. If you go this route and need to return it, reapply your own thermal paste and a fresh thermal pad of the same color and thickness as the original (no idea what thickness it is unfortunately) and pray they don't look closely at it for your best chance of getting a replacement.   2) As mentioned, there is thermal gel/paste between the thermal pad and the controller that should be cleaned before using without a heatsink or another heatsink, plus that will dry on the thermal pad.   3) thermal pads are not really reusable, especially if it's left unattached for as it will likely harden after some time  4) As they note, the screws are *very* soft. Be extremely careful when removing and make sure you use the correct driver head to avoid both straight up stripping the screws as well as leaving obvious marks that the drive was disassembled.   5) the 1TB is single-sided (2TB is double-sided, meaning chips on both sides), but the heatsink goes all the way around the drive, which may cause clearance issues in some slots. Most desktop slots are fine with double-sided drives, but I suspect the heatsink is reused among both, some motherboards may have components underneath that are fine with double-sided drive but not double-sided + heatsink underneath. Be wary.   Just choose carefully I guess, the heatsink is definitely worth the $3 if you want it as aftermarket options are $10+ rarely quite as nice as this, just keep in mind where you're using it now as well as into the future as motherboards now more and more come with built-in heatsinks that either can't be removed themselves or mess with other things if left off. Same goes for any possible usecases in limited clearance scenarios, like a mini PC or laptop or even some desktop slots.",Positive,2022-12-19 12:04:00,1
