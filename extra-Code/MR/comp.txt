Computing is everywhere: from manufacturing to advertising, from social life to sitting quietly with an e-book. What are the rules that govern the devices and networks that are so important in our daily lives? How do they work? Computer programs and services that we use every day are among the most complex artifacts ever constructed by humans. How can such complex systems be structured so that they are easily repaired or modified? The BS in Computer Science at DePaul CDM prepares students to answer such questions, providing them with the skills necessary to contribute to this vital aspect of our culture. Computer Science is a richly rewarding intellectual discipline that combines aspects of mathematics, science and engineering. Once students have mastered the basic vocabulary of algorithms, programming, and systems, a world of interdisciplinary opportunities become available human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence and computational finance, to name a few as well as applications across the arts and sciences.
