SERVICE LEVELS 3.1 The Annex 1 to Part A of this Schedule sets out the Service Levels the performance of which the Parties have agreed to measure. 3.2 The Supplier shall monitor its performance of the Services by reference to the relevant Performance Criteria and Target for achieving the Service Level(s) shown in Annex 1 to Part A of this Schedule and shall send Worldpay a monthly report detailing the level of service which was achieved in accordance with the provisions of Part B of this Schedule ( \"Performance Report\"). 3.3 The Supplier shall, at all times, provide the Services in such a manner that the Service Levels are achieved. 3.4 If the level of performance of the Supplier of any element of the provision by it of the Services during the Term fails to achieve a Service Level (’Service Failure\"), the Supplier shall immediately notify Worldpay in writing and Worldpay, in its absolute discretion and without prejudice to any other of its rights under the Agreement or in law, may: 3.4.1 require the Supplier to immediately take all remedial action that is reasonable to mitigate the impact on Worldpay and to rectify or prevent a Service Failure from taking place or recurring; and 3.4.2 if the action taken under paragraph 3.4.1 above has not already prevented or remedied the Service Failure, provide Worldpay with a correction plan (the \"Correction Plan\") within five (5) Business Days (or such other period as the Parties agree in writing) from the day the Supplier notifies Worldpay under paragraph 3.4. above. The Supplier will set out in the Correction Plan the action that it will take to prevent the Service Failure or rectify and prevent the Service Failure from recurring. The Supplier will obtain Worldpay's approval of such Correction Plan (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and carry out the approved Correction Plan in accordance with its terms; or 3.4.3 make a deduction from the Charges in accordance with Annex 1 to Part A of this Schedule; or 3.4.4 if the Service Failure constitutes a Critical Service Failure, Worldpay shall be entitled to terminate the Agreement pursuant to Clause 16.1(e). 3.5 Approval and implementation of any Correction Plan by Worldpay shall not relieve the Supplier of any responsibility to achieve the Service Levels, or remedy any failure to do so, and no waiver shall arise from any such approval and\/or implementation. 4. SERVICE CREDITS 4.1 The Service Credit calculation set out in Annex 1 to Part A sets out the mechanism used to calculate Service Credits payable to Worldpay as a result of a failure to meet the Service Level in a given service period which, for the purpose of this Schedule, shall be quarterly throughout the Term (the \"Service Period\"). 4.2 Annex 1 to Part A of this Schedule includes details of the Service Credits available for Service Levels if not met by the Supplier. 4.3 Worldpay shall use Performance Reports supplied by the Supplier to verify the calculation and accuracy of the Service Credits, if any, applicable to each relevant Service Period.

NATURE OF SERVICE CREDITS 5.1 The Supplier confirms that it has modelled the Service Credits and has taken them into account in setting the level of the Charges. Both Parties agree that the Service Credits are a reasonable method of price adjustment to reflect poor performance and are not an estimate of the loss that may be suffered by Worldpay as a result of the Supplier's failure to meet any Service Level, and is without prejudice to any other remedies Worldpay may have resulting from, or otherwise arising in respect of, any breach by the Supplier of this Agreement in relation to Service Levels.

Performance against Service Levels will be measured, reported and monitored on a monthly basis for the first six months of the Term and then on a quarterly basis. 2. Service Credits will apply if a Service Level is missed for any rolling 3 month period or missed 4 months in a 12 month period (measured every 6 months from the Effective Date). 3. A Service Credit will be available: - if the Supplier does not perform to the Target level against a Measured Service\/SLA in the above table for three (3) consecutive months or 4 months in a 12 month period (measured every 6 months), the Supplier will decrease its transaction fees set out in the Statements of Work by two per cent (2%) for each Measured Service which has failed to meet the Target, to a maximum limit of six per cent (6%), for the following quarter. This will be calculated every quarter, on a calendar basis (from January to March, April to June, July to September and October to December). Each Measured Service is weighted one per cent (2%). as an example, if 2 Measured Services are not reached, a Service Credit of 4% (2% x 2) of the total transaction fees will be due to Worldpay. This will be taken in the form of a 4% reduction in the transaction fees set out in the Statements of Work for the following quarter. in no event shall the Supplier be obligated to pay Worldpay more than 6% of the total quarterly transaction fees as set out in the Statements of Work as a service credit for Measured Services. If the Supplier misses a Service Level for any one single month this will be recorded by Worldpay and remedial action points will be agreed between the Parties.

Part 5. Provisions relating to Assessments ai’rf Site Visits This Part is relevant for all Services that may include assessments and site visits. 3.

In its sole and absolute discretion, BSI will select the appropriate assessors to perform the assessments. BSI may change the assessor at any time. In the event of a change in assessor by BSI, no additional fees will be charged to you. Except where prohibited by scheme rules or regulatory directives, you may request BSI to change the assessor with at least thirty (30) days' written notice prior to the commencement of an assessment, provided that you agree to pay any additionai fees or expenses incurred by BSI in providing an alternative assessor. If no appropriate assessor is available, BSI may in its sole and absolute discretion refuse your request. z Arrangement of Assessment Visits to your Sites BSI will arrange visits to your site or sites as expressly described in the Proposal, or, if later, as may be expressly agreed with you in writing. It may be necessary for BSI to visit third party sites not under your direct control, for example critical sub¬ contractors or crucial suppliers (these are sub-contractors and suppliers who provide products or perform services that are material to the subject matter of the Services). In such cases, BSI shall inform you of the need to visit such other sites and you shall procure the right of BSI to enter such sites for the purposes of audit pursuant to the Services. If BSI is not able to enter such additional sites for any reason, such inability may cause a delay to the delivery of the Services, or a termination of the Contract (at the sole determination of BSI). All fees payable for the delayed Services or up to date of termination shall be payable irrespective of BSI's audit of such third party sites. If the timetable for visits is determined by the relevant standard or scheme, you and BSI each agree to comply with that timetable. If the frequency of visits is not fixed by the relevant standard or scheme, BSI will arrange them at its reasonable discretion. In each case, you will provide BSI and its assessor all reasonable access to all and any areas of the site, data and records, and any materials and equipment as the assessor deems reasonably necessary in order to allow the assessor to undertake the assessment. (Change of date of site visit) Either party may change the date of a visit. In order to do this: if you change the date of the visit: you must do so by giving not fewer than thirty (30) days advance written notice to BSI. If you fail to give the required written notice, you will be liable to pay the full fee for the originally booked visit. You may not delay the date of a visit if to do so would have the effect of invalidating your certification; : : if BSI changes the date of the visit: While BSI will endeavor to provide you with as much advance notice as possible under the circumstances, it may do this at any time up to twenty-four (24) hours prior to the booked date of the visit, and BSI will contact you to arrange for an alternate date. In certain circumstances (such as non-compliance with the relevant standard, consummation of a transaction or business reorganization that could materially affect operation of your management system, or investigation pursuant to a third party complaint) it may be necessary for BSI to make additional visits. You will be liable for the fee for any additional visits at the assessment rate set out in the Proposal. Observed visits BSI's assessor may be accompanied by a third party observer from time to time, who is to witness an assessment which may be required by scheme rules or for BSI internal training purposes. BSI will inform you, as well as provide you with the identity of the observer, within a reasonable time prior to the visit. A third party observer will be subject to confidentiality obligations at least to the same level as those to which BSI is bound in accordance with this Contract. The fee for the visit will not be increased due to the visit being observed. 4 Assessors' Health and Safety (Hazard^) When an assessor attends your premises, you are responsible for ensuring that adequate information is given on the hazards and risks to which the assessor may be exposed. You will provide the assessor with an appropriate level of supervision as well as all necessary personal protective equipment. You will immediately notify BSI of any event, accident or incident on your premises which could pose a risk to an assessor. (BSI's right to abort a visit) If, while on your premises, the assessor has reason to believe that you are not complying with the relevant health and safety rules, or that the assessor's safety is at risk in any way, then the assessor may abort the visit. BSI will report to you the reasons for the termination of the visit. In such an event, BSI will not be in breach of the Contract and you will be required to pay in full for the Services. BSI will not attend the affected premises again until it is satisfied that the issues so reported have been resolved. Assessors' Entry Requirements You must, at the time of arranging a visit, notify BSI of the health and safety rules and any other reasonable security requirements applicable to visitors to the premises. BSI will observe, or will use reasonable endeavors to procure the observance of, as far as it is reasonably able, all such health and safety rules and any other reasonable security requirements that you notify to BSI, and notify to the assessor on arrival at the site. If, by observing these rules and other requirements, BSI is prevented from providing the Services, BSI will not be in breach of the Contract and you will be required to pay in full for the Services. If the Proposal requires a visit to a third party’s premises, you undertake, warrant and represent that you have a relationship with the third party that permits BSI to attend the premises of the third party for the purposes of the Contract. ft Damages for failure to meet the number of audit days requested If, either through your cancellation of agreed and booked audit dates, or through your termination of this Contract prior to our being able to provide you with any of the Services, you fail to meet the number of audit days requested by you (and stated in the Proposal) in any one year, for any reason other than a Force Majeure (please see Part 9, section , below) or our fault, you shall pay to us on demand $150 for each audit day not taken in the relevant year, as liquidated damages. Both of us confirm that this sum represents a genuine pre-estimate of our losses. 7 Term of Proposal If an initial assessment is not conducted within one year of the date of the Proposal due to any reason other than the fault of 651, this Contract shall terminate insofar as it relates to Assessment and Site visits, and you will need to reapply for such services, which may be at other rates to the ones quoted to you in the Proposal.

If applicable, you will, on receipt of a valid tax invoice from BSI, pay to BSI such additional amounts in respect of tax as may be chargeable at the same time as payment is due for the supply of the Services. {Interest on overdue amounts) If you fail to make a payment due to BSI under the Contract by its due date as set out in the Proposal, BSI may charge interest on the overdue amount at the rate of 2.5 per cent a year above the then current base rate of BSI's bankers, accruing on a daily basis from the due date until the date of actual payment, which will be compounded quarterly. {Ifa third party is to pay) If you arrange for a third party to pay any of BSI's fees or charges, you remain liable to the extent that the third party does not pay in full by the due date. 3 Remedies, Waiver and Rights of Third Parties A waiver of any right or remedy under this Contract is only effective if given in writing and shall not be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach or default. A failure or delay by a party to exercise any right or remedy provided under this Contract or by law shall not constitute a waiver of that or any other right or remedy, nor shall it preclude or restrict any further exercise of that or any other right or remedy. No single or partial exercise of any right or remedy provided under this Contract or by law shall preclude or restrict the further exercise of any such right or remedy. The rights and remedies provided under the Contract are in addition to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies provided by law governing the Contract. A person who is not a party to this agreement shall not have any rights under or in connection with it. 4 Appeals If you wish to appeal a decision made by BSI, you must serve written notice of your intention to appeal within twenty-one (21) days of receipt of the BSI decision.

A decision made pursuant to the appeals procedure shall be final and you and BSI each agree to adhere to that decision. 5 Limitation of Liability Notwithstanding any other provision of this Contract, neither party's liability under or in connection with this Contract shall be excluded or limited to the extent that such exclusion or limitation is not otherwise permitted by law. Subject to this, BSI will not be liable to you for any loss of profit, loss of goodwill, or any indirect or consequential loss arising under or in connection with the Contract, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), breach of statutory duty, or otherwise; and the total liability of BSI to you in respect of all other losses arising under or in connection with the Contract, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), breach of statutory duty, or otherwise, will not exceed an amount equal to the annual fees payable by you under the Contract in relation to the Services giving rise to the liability. This limitation of BSI's liability will survive termination of the Contract. 6 Force Majeure Other than with respect to your obligation to pay all fees and expenses pursuant to Section 2 of Part 9 of this Contract (above), neither you nor BSI will be in breach of the Contract if it is not reasonably possible to perform an obligation under the Contract due to circumstances beyond that party's reasonable control.

For the avoidance of doubt the mobile and tablet devices shall be sourced by BugFinders and at its cost. Customer will be responsible for supplying the PED’s. 8. Execution of testing on the various web platforms including the on boarding sites. 9. Raising and reviewing of the bugs in the BugFinders portal. 10. Management of the remote team of testers. 11. Full access to the BugFinders portal for WorldPay and WorldPay appointed partners. 12. Daily test progress reports during test execution where necessary. 13. Test Exit reports including test case execution reports. 14. Feeding into best practice and project reviews where appropriate. 15. Providing innovation support learning for WorldPay for feeding back best practice across the wider business. Portal: The portal is accessed through any PC web-browser by visiting www.bugfinders.com and selecting sign-in. Typically, a username or email address and password will allow access. Customer shall have the opportunity to invite other people to its projects including without limitation internal developers, designers, project managers. In addition, third party service providers of the Customer may be given either view only, or limited access to the bug to change status as required. Such third party log on will only allow bug status modifications to either Fixed or On-hold. Once logged in, the Customer (and any parties referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph) is able to see the recent activity as well as the projects that have been run. Each project will display the bugs that have been reviewed and each bug will contain screen shots Page 13 of 22 WORLDPAY AND BUGFINDERS CONTRACT tei : *44 (0) 844 870 8710 email: enquiries@bugfinders.com Commercial In Confidence www.bugfinders.com or video as well as clear instructions of how to reproduce and the device or platform that the bug was found on. Summary reports can be extracted by the Customer once the project has completed and these reports will detail the coverage that has been achieved. The Customer will also be able to download a CSV report of the bugs which can be used to import into various bug tracking tools that the Customer may have. BugFinders may also be used as a bug management tool with various options available for the Customer to manage the bugs through to the next cycle. For example, bugs can be assigned to an individual or a group for fixing. Each bug will also have a flagging feature which allows the Customer to highlight the bug for a number of reasons. Typically these will include the fact that the bug is not useful, further information is required, expected behaviour as well as other forms of communication back to BugFinders. The BugFinders team will review this to ensure that they have understood the feedback and then modify the review process accordingly moving forward if necessary. Traceability Matrix: BugFinders shall be responsible for operating a traceability matrix. This will be managed remotely and provide updates to WorldPay upon request by WorldPay. Internationalisation: Upon request by the Customer, BugFinders will support a launch of the WorldPay Zinc services into countries outside the United Kingdom. At Customer’s request this may involve using Testers who are located in or from such other countries. Documentation produced There are a range of documents that BugFinders will produce at Customer’s request to manage the full end to end solution for the Customer. Document Reason\nTest Strategy This is an overall document that contains details of the approach that will be used to test a program. Previously BugFinders have been involved in producing strategies when companies have embarked into either web or mobile with little or no experience before-hand. The strategy document is effective in defining an optimum approach for the testing.\nTest Plan The test plan is project specific to a project. When BugFinders manage and run a project, BugFinders can support by producing a Test Plan which will detail the test cases, the approach, what coverage is required and how the testing will be delivered. This is a very effective tool to measure BugFinder’s performance and cross reference the exit criteria to ensure that the coverage is met. It also helps in the decision to go live or not.\nTest Cases Test cases are individual steps to complete the testing. BugFinders can write and execute these scripts on a variety of equipment. Because of the scalability nature of the BugFinders team, it is able to complete massive coverage of test scripts in very little time. For example, BugFinders\nWORLDPAY AND BUGFINDERS Page 14 of 22 Commercial in Confidence CONTRACT www.bugfinders.com let : +44 (0)844 870 8710 email: enquiries@bugfinders.com completed a project with 73 test scripts (average 14 test steps per case) with 27 testers in just 3 days (1 working day). Effectively that is over 27500 test steps in 1 working day.\nTest Exit Report The Test Exit Report is produced at the end of a project and verifies the coverage that has been delivered. It cross references the original test plan (or expected test plan) to verify if the software meets the exit criteria or quality criteria.\nQuarterly Reviews The parties will carry out quarterly reviews in detail of any projects that have been carried out in the previous three (3) months and any improvements that should be made for any upcoming projects and projects that are already underway. The estimated dates for the quarterly review during the Initial Term of 12 months are as set out below. w\/c 11 November 2013 w\/c 10 February 2014 w\/c 12 June 2014 w\/c 11 August 2014 It is important that key stakeholders attend this meeting. The dates for the quarterly review during any Renewal Term shall be mutually agreed between the parties. Project Types: With each framework there are a number of levels. These are: - Project (A project to be completed) o (Opt) Phase ■ Cycle • Test Cases Framework: An encompassing arrangement covering multiple projects. - Project: A specific project related to a build of code or code base. - Optional - Phase: Larger projects may require multiple phases to run through - Cycle: A phase of development or re-development. - Test Cases: These are small scripts that execute a level of functionality. These are required if you need sign-off of capability in a specific area. The Retainer The Customer agrees to pay a monthly retainer to maintain the availability of an elite team of Testers for projects at any point required by it during the Initial Term or any Renewal Term. The retainer cost for 30 testers and Chip & PIN devices is £3,250 (Three thousand two hundred and fifty pounds) per month (plus VAT) The retainer shall also entitle the Customer Page 15 of 22 WORLDPAY AND BUGFINDERS CONTRACT tel : +44 (0)844 870 8710 email: enquiries@bugfinders.com Commercial in Confidence www.bugfinders.com to one day of on-site support per month. It is expected that this will be a regular day each month, but the Customer may request that this is changed. If the Customer elects not to utilise such day in any given month, then that day shall roll over into a subsequent month but on the basis that the maximum number of on-site days included within the retainer shall be twelve (12) in each 12 month term. Additional Support: The Customer may also request additional support on an 'as and when needed’ basis at the following rates: Martin Mudge (or any successor with equivalent skills) £800 per day Test Manager £625 per day For payment purposes, the term is deemed to start on 22nd January 2014. The Term is 12 months. Project Costs The cost for each applicable project shall vary depending on the size of the project and the number of test cycles involved. Details of the costs are set out in the table below and the size and costs associated with each particular project shall be agreed in writing between the parties and reflected in a purchase order to be submitted by the Customer before each project commences. The categories of project are defined as follows: Large Projects: New components developed and considerable change to the WorldPay Zinc products, for example this may include a European roll out. Medium Projects: Smaller changes to the WorldPay Zinc product that require running of regression packs, for example the WorldPay Zinc project known within WorldPay as ‘Project Elephant’. Small Projects: Regression packs where bug fixes are delivered. No need to write test cases. Involves simply re-executing scripts. Item Cost £’s\nLarge Project - Full App testing - Service Portal testing - Up to 6 cycles 24,000\nMedium Project - Full App testing - Service Portal testing - Up to 3 cycles 12,000\nSmall Project - I.e. On boarding etc - Regression pack and bug spot fixes - Up to 3 cycles 4,000\nWORLDPAY AND BUGFINDERS Page 16 of 22 CONTRACT tel :+44 (0)844 870 8710 email: enquiries@bugfinders.com Commercial in Confidence www.bugfinders.com 50% discount for a single cycle of the on boarding portal.\nRisk\/Reward Mechanism The table below shows the discount if the project is released sooner than expected with\nfewer test cycles.\nLarge Medium Small\nProject - Project - Project -\nCompleted Completed Completed\nin Cycles Cost In Cycles Cost In Cycles Cost\n5 £22,800\n4 £21,360 2 £3,800\n3 £20,000 2 £10,680 1 £2,800\n2 £18,960 1 £9,480 0 0\n1 £16,840 0 £7,920\n0 £12,000\nExtra\nCycles £2,160 £1,800 £1200\nScope changes Minor scope changes: If the scope of the Customer's project changes, then this can normally be easily dealt with for minor changes at no extra cost to Customer. For example, originally, the Customer may decide to have Internet Explorer 6 in scope, however on clarifying with colleagues after the project launch, it may be decided that it will no longer be in scope. In this instance, the Customer needs to let BugFinders know as soon as possible, either by phone or email launch@buqfinders.com. If the change is small - BugFinders can update the Testers and BugFinders will archive the bugs already found. Major scope changes: If the change in scope is much more major, for example the wrong site is being tested, BugFinders will work with the Customer to work out the best course of action. If the project is near the end, then BugFinders may need to launch a new project, however it I has just started, then it is more likely that BugFinders can change to meet the need. Schedule: The following schedule will be relevant to cycle 2+. Day Task Responsible\n1 Provide requirements WorldPay\n4 Complete test scope and scripts BugFinders\n6 Test scope and scripts signed off WorldPay\n8 Execute test scripts BugFinders\n11 Testing complete (allowing 3 full days) BugFinders\n12 Test report provided BugFinders\nWORLDPAY AND BUGFINDERS Page 17 of 22 CONTRACT tel : *44 (0) 844 870 8710 email: enquiries@bugfinders.com Commercial in Confidence www.bugfinders.com Please note, this refers to a single cycle. Relationship with Testers: BugFinders will have an arrangement with the Testers, broadly under its standard conditions which at a minimum include the following. - BugFinders agree a contract with the Testers (as relevant for the equipment). This contract means that the Testers commit to looking after the equipment and delivering the work as required. BugFinders will take a security deposit from the Testers to ensure careful treatment of the equipment. This is complimented by the contract which also expresses that the Testers look after the equipment. BugFinders will then send the equipment to the Tester and pay them a retainer on a monthly basis to maintain the equipment and their capability. Relevant to test cards provided by Worldpay in order to perform transaction testing (these are not real cards and do not touch live regions. For any test cards which WorldPay releases to Bug Finders, an indemnity form will need to be completed by BugFinders. In the event that the test cards are lost or damaged, Bug Finders will be charged and pay £15 per card by WorldPay. The cards will have a 12 month shelflife and after this point, there will be no replacement charge. Assumptions for Projects The basis for these projects are as follows: BugFinders will: - Develop a light test plan - Develop the test scripts as a reusable artefact. - Deliver test scripts for client signoff. Complete and provide evidence of execution of the scripts on the defined devices. - Work onsite and to develop the full set of test scripts for sign-off. - Test the full functionality as defined by the test scripts - Provide a test exit report on conclusion of the testing. - Complete the testing phase within a 3 day period (5 days on first cycle). Assumptions: - BugFinders will test the all the functionality except the following: o MMP0009 and MMP0010 (additional charge for hardware) o MMP0013 - you cannot provide us with passwords for the log update system. - Cards will be provided by the testers although test cards maybe required from the Customer at a later stage. - After the initial supply, any unexpectedly lost card devices will be charged at £50 per unit. Testers will pay a deposit to hold these devices and BugFinders will contribute. - To ensure the testing can be delivered in the appropriate time period, 5 days notice will be required before entering the testing phase. Page 18 of 22 WORLDPAY AND BUGFINDERS CONTRACT tel : *44 (0) 844 870 8710 email: enquiries@bugfinders.com Commercial in Confidence www.bugfinders.com SCHEDULE 2 - HOURS OF AVAILABILITY AND SERVICE LEVELS The BugFinders portal will be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year with no downtime (except for (ii) scheduled maintenance which has been notified to Customer at least a week in advance and during a time of least disruption to Customer’s operations and (ii) Force Majeure events). The BugFinders UK office will be manned from 9am to 5.30pm five days a week excluding public holidays. The BugFinders Testers will be available from 7am to 11pm seven days a week, 365 days a year for projects to be launched. Outside of regular office hours, contact can be made to 07791 800 712 and supported with an email to launch@buqfinders.com. During standard working hours, to engage with BugFinders the Customer can either call 0844 870 8710 or email launch@bugfinders.com to make BugFinders aware that there is a project to launch. Outside of these hours the Customer can contact Martin Mudge on 07791 800 712 or Donna Mudge on 07870 196 722. The escalation point within BugFinders for any issues the Customer may have will be : Martin Mudge Technical Director Mobile: 07791 800 712 DD: 01242 500 937 Email: martin@bugfinders.com. Multi-cycle projects Projects are typically split into a number of cycles which indicate the various iterations that it will go through. A project may consist of one iteration or multiple iterations. An example of this can be found below. Cycle 1: Testing starts and a number of bugs will be raised. The developer will then fix those. - Cycle 2: BugFinders will retest the bugs raised and simultaneously launch a new project for the community to find new issues. - Cycle 3: Often projects will be completed with a reduced bug count in this final cycle, however which is the same construct as Cycle 2, however, further cycles can be run as required until the project is complete. Most projects include 3 cycles or more. Service Level Agreement Timeframes BugFinders will ensure that it meets the service levels and service level timeframes referred to herein. Time Description Elapsed (mins)\nInitiation Customer sends email to launch@buqfinders.com or calls BugFinders HQ. A scoping document can be prefilled to save time. 0\nScoping BugFinders will produce a scoping document, which 15\nPage 19 of 22 WORLDPAY AND BUGFINDERS CONTRACT tel : +44 (0)844 870 8710 email: enquiries@bugfinders.com Commercial in Confidence www.bugfinders.com Please note - test scripting is not included timeframe. details what should be tested. If sufficient detail is not in place, then BugFinders will call the Customer to ensure that sufficient information is obtained. The finalised scoping document defines the time frame and information about which devices or browsers should be covered. The Customer may need to decide the size of the application and put it in the scoping document (see definitions of project size). BugFinders will send the draft scoping document the to Customer.\nAcceptance Once the Customer is happy that the scoping document is complete, the Customer will send it, along with any other information (i.e. functional spec etc) to the launch@buqfinders.com 20\nSmoke During this process, BugFinders will smoke test the new site or application to ensure it works appropriately for community testers to work on it. a. BugFinders will review the scoping document to ensure that there are no questions. b. BugFinders will check the link or the application launch correctly on one of our devices. c. BugFinders will upload the project so that its Testers can start working on it. 30\nLaunch Once BugFinders receive the accepted scoping document, BugFinders will the launch process. 35\nTesting Testers will start raising bugs and submitting them to BugFinders. 40\nReview The BugFinders internal team will review and replicate the bugs that are found to ensure that they are valid. 75\nStart fixing The Customer will start to see the first bugs in the portal and are able to start fixing them. 120 mins to 24 hrs\nThe whole process above takes as little as 1 (one) hour. Once a project has been launched,, depending on BugFinders resource, bugs that have been verified can be seen within about 1 further hour, however it is better to allow up to 50% of the test cycle before looking to see the bugs. The BugFinders team realise that it is important to ensure the Customer gets the best results possible and will monitor the project to pick up on all ambiguities in the project and make the Customer aware of these. For example, if spellings are in scope, but a large number of spellings mistakes are found in one area, BugFinders will contact the Customer to confirm that spellings are expected to be correct in this area. Customer Responsibilities Test Environment. It is important the test environment is 100% available during the testing window and has an appropriate level of performance so that the Testers do not raise performance related issues. In addition, it is important that the environment is stable with no Page 20 of 22 WORLDPAY AND BUGFINDERS CONTRACT tel :-*-44(0) 844 870 8710 email: enquiries@bugfinders.com Commercial in Confidence www.bugfinders.com code changes being made during the testing window unless the BugFinders team agree, for example if there is a major bug that needs to be resolved and if the project is not agile. Clear Scoping. The scoping documents should be clear and detail exactly what the Customer needs and looks for from the testing. For example, if the Customer does not want Internet Explorer 6 covered, then Internet Explorer 6 should not be in scope. Whilst this seems to be quite an obvious point, it is important that this is covered accurately because: 1. The Customer may not have developed for that platform, so there may be a lot of bugs on that platform. This means that the Testers will find that this creates noise and this gets in the way of raising the actual bugs. 2. The Customer is not going to fix these bugs anyway, so it would be a waste of time. Test results scenarios A bug has been raised that is not useful Bugs that aren't useful tend to fall into two categories: 1. Valid bugs that aren’t useful. Part of a consequence of the exhaustive methods that BugFinders uses can sometimes find bugs that are not worth fixing or that are not particularly useful. In this instance, the Customer can change the status to archived so that the Customer doesn’t see them in the regular view. The Customer can also flag them, to let BugFinders know that they weren’t useful. 2. Bugs that not bugs. BugFinders don't want to send the Customer bugs that the Customer does not see as bugs, so the parties will work together to minimise this. This may include improving the scoping, explaining the functionality a little further or BugFinders understanding of the Customer’s business. If this kind of issue comes through, the Customer can simply flag them with a description and BugFinders will investigate it for the Customer. More information is needed about a specific bug If a bug that has been raised and the Customer needs more information about it, the Customer can use the flag button to flag it and get more information. This will highlighted to BugFinders who can then get the information and supply it back to the Customer, either in the bug or via email if the Customer refers. When BugFinders haven’t reviewed a bug Occasionally, it is not possible to review a bug (crashes, foreign specific issue etc). In these circumstances, BugFinders will make it clear that it hasn’t reviewed the bug so that the Customer understands that this needs to be treated more carefully. BugFinders will also follow up with the Customer to verify that it was a bug and to see if BugFinders can learn anything from it.

Remaining metrics REMAINING METRICS - A None listed, REMAINING METRICS - B Business Partners Business Partners are natural persons, a group of persons, or a legal entity that has any kind of a business relationship with a company or a public sector agency. The number of Business Partners counted for pricing the solution is limited to the context of the Software being licensed. REMAINING METRICS-C Calls Calls are the number of incoming messages per year. External service calls are HTTP requests per calendar year which are processed by SAP NetWeaver Gateway Server. Metadata requests and requests from SAP Software that contains SAP NetWeaver Gateway runtime software are not counted. Chips Chips are individual electronic circuitries containing one or more Cores, usually on a silicon wafer. Contacts Contacts are number of unique records of customers, prospects, employees, business partners, and constituents within the context of the Software, Cores Cores are the number of cores in CPUs that are available for use by the licensed software. The number of Core licenses must be an integer. When counting physical Cores, each Core of a physical CPU that runs at least parts of the licensed software, including those that are temporarily assigned or scheduled to cover peak processing, is considered and counted. When counting virtual Core's, each virtual Core that runs at least parts of the licensed software, including those that are temporarily assigned or scheduled to cover peak processing, is counted. If the licensed Software will run in a pure virtual environment, physical Cores will not be counted. For purposes of clarification, \"Core\" as defined in this metric definition is different from “core\" as referenced in the metric definition for any Software licensed on a CPU basis (if any), and therefore is not applicable in that context. CPUs are the central processing units (\"CPU”) that runs at least parts of the licensed Software. When the Software or Third Party Software is licensed on a CPU basis, any server or computer on which the Software or Third Party Software is installed may not exceed the aggregate number of CPU licensed. A multi-core chip CPU with N processor cores shall be counted as follows: the first processor core in each processor shall be counted as 1 CPU, and each incremental processor core in such processor shall be counted as 0.5 CPU, and then the total CPU count will be rounded to the next whole number (the \"CPU Calculation\"). See Example 1 below for an illustration of the application of this licensing requirement. Software based on a CPU license metric basis licensed by Licensee on or after July 1, 2009 (the \"Qualified Software\") will contain Virtualization Rights (defined below). Virtualization Rights are not applied to Software licensed prior to July 1, 2009 or upgrades and updates thereto subsequently made available to Licensee pursuant to Support Services. Licensee may not combine licenses having express Virtualization Rights with licenses not having express Virtualization Right in a single Deployment. 28 SAP Confidential SAP OEM Order Form (BOSL) enUS v.2-2014 DocuSign Envelope ID: 7017F556-57AE-4011-B1B8-CA0EDC00AA6F In the event that Licensee employs industry standard tools and methodologies enabling Licensee to logically partition or pool its processing power, Licensee may install the Qualified Software on servers or computers consisting of a number of physical CPUs greater than the number of CPUs licensed hereunder provided that Licensee shall configure such servers or computers in a manner such that the tola! number of CPUs (or total number of virtual processor cores if virtualization software is implemented), or any portion thereof, made available to run the Qualified Software, or any portion thereof, does not exceed the number of CPUs licensed (\"Virtualization Rights\"). For the purposes hereof, a CPU (or virtual processor core) shall be deemed available to run the Qualified Software if such CPU (or virtual processor core) or any portion thereof is available to run the Qualified Software at any time for any purpose, including but not limited to permanent, temporary, scheduled, and on-demand availability. Under the Virtualization Rights, where virtualization software is implemented, only virtual processor cores made available to run the Qualified Software will be counted in accordance with the CPU Calculation. See Example 2 below for an illustration of the application of this licensing requirement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for Third Party Software licensed on a CPU basis, each processor core shall count as 1 CPU, and every CPU (whether Used productively or non-productively) shall count against the CPU license level for such Third Party Software. Virtualization Rights do not apply to Third Party Software. EXAMPLE 1: One quad core processor wilt count as 2.5 CPUs (or 1 CPU for the first core, plus 0.5 multiplied by 3 for the subsequent 3 cores) rounding up to 3 CPUs. Therefore, Licensee will be required to license 3 CPUs if the Software is installed on a quad core server. Another example may involve a server with three quad core processors. As illustrated above, each quad core processor will represent 2.5 CPUs. Three quad core processors will total 7.5 CPUs (or 2.5 CPUs multiplied by 3) rounding up to 8 CPUs. Therefore, Licensee will be required to license 8 CPUs if the Software is installed on a server with 3 quad core processors. EXAMPLE 2 (Virtualization Rights): A server has 16 physical dual core CPUs in a configuration where up to 4 virtual dual core processors are made available to run the Qualified Software. In this case, each virtual dual core processor will count as 1.5 CPUs (or 1 CPU for the first core, plus 0.5 for the second core). Four virtual dual core processors will total 6 CPUs (or 1.5 CPUs multiplied by 4). Therefore, Licensee will be required to license 6 CPUs under this virtualization configuration. REMAINING METRICS-D Database Sizes Gigabyte database sizes are database sizes of the productive systems and are calculated individually for each system (i.e., each ERP, Bl and CRM system). 1.5 Terabyte accumulated database sizes are the database sizes of all productive SAP systems where the customer uses SAP Landscape Transformation.

DEFINITIONS OF SEVERITY LEVELS Production Systems Licensor has defined the priorities for problem Incidents in SAP Note 67739, a copy of which can be found at: h ftps .'\/\/service.san. com\/sap\/support\/notes\/67739). Test Systems For the same problem situation in a test system, priorities should usually be classified with a rating that is one level lower than for production systems. 3. SERVICE LEVELS Service levels are not available for all Software. The list of Software where Service Levels are not applicable can be found at: httpsd\/partneredqe.sap.com\/en\/partnership\/support\/oem-support.html. Software that are eligible for service levels are referred herein as \"Eligible Software1’, When Partner reports malfunctions, Licensor supports Partner by providing information on how to remedy, avoid or bypass errors. The main channel for such support will be the support infrastructure provided by Licensor. Partner may send an error message relating to any Eligible Software at any time. All persons involved in the Incident solving process can access the status of the Incident at any time. Licensor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to comply with the Initial Reaction Times (IRT) and Maximum Processing Times during Regular Working Hours for the Eligible Software regarding support Incidents (messages) when communicating with the Partner. Priority of Support Incidents Initial Reaction Time (IRT) Maximum Processing Time (provision of solution, action plan ot workaround) ra 1 = very high a 1 hour1 4 hours 1 b 2 = high is 4 working hours s 2 working days 1 - English language support during Regular Working Hours only Priority 1 Support Incidents (“Very High’’). An Incident is assigned Priority 1 if the problem has very serious consequences for normal business transactions and urgent, business critical work cannot be performed. This is generally caused by the following circumstances: complete system outage, malfunctions of central functions in the Production System, or Top-Issues. -47- FIS Order Form No 1 FIS executable.docx SAP Opp. 3015225881 Quote 83320494 \/ Case 3060322879 DocuSign Envelope ID: 7017F556-57AE-4011-B1B8-CA0EDC00AA6F Priority 2 Support Incidents (''High\"). An incident is assigned Priority 2 if normal business transactions in a Production System are seriously affected and necessary tasks cannot be performed. This is caused by incorrect, insecure or inoperable functions in the Licensor system that is required to perform such transactions and\/or tasks. For Eligible Software, Licensor will commence Incident handling on errors of very high priority (for a definition of priorities, see SAP Note 67739) within 24 hours, 7 days a week provided that the following conditions are met: (i) The error must be reported in English and (ii) Partner must have a suitably skilled English-speaking employee at hand so that Partner and Licensor can communicate if Licensor assigns the problem Incident to an overseas Licensor support center. If either or both of these conditions are not fulfilled, Licensor may not be able to start Incident handling or to continue Incident handling until these conditions are fulfilled. Initial Reaction Time » Licensor shall confirm receipt of an Incident and provide Partner with an initial qualified response. Maximum Processing Time Licensor shall provide a solution, action plan or workaround b Partner shall forward the support Incident to Licensor within the agreed timeframe if the cause of the defect in the Support Incident indicates a previously unknown problem with the Software coding. ra Licensor is under no obligation to provide a fix for previously unknown bugs, except that Licensor will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide a fix, action plan or workaround to the extent it is required to enable the Software to substantially conform to the specifications contained in the Documentation. h Times only refer to that part of the processing time, when the Incident is being processed by Licensor (\"Processing Time\"). The Processing Time does not include the time, when the message is on status \"Partner Action\", \"Customer Action\" or \"Licensor Proposed Solution”, whereas: ® The status \"Partner Action\" means the Incident was handed over to a technology or software partner of Licensor or a third party vendor of Licensor outside the Licensor's organization for further processing. - The status \"Customer Action\" means the Incident was handed over to Partner. 9 The status \"Licensor Proposed Solution\" means Licensor has provided a Corrective Action (see note below). a For Eligible Software, the Maximum Processing Time for Priority 1 “Very High\" support Incidents is measured in real time, provided the Partner maintains availability to continue working with Licensor outside of normal business hours. For Support Incidents with any other priority, the time is measured in working hours during Licensor's normal business hours. a Where Licensor provides an action plan to Partner, such action plan wilt include descriptions of: 8 the status of the resolution process; 0 the next steps planned by Licensor and the responsible persons allocated by Licensor; 8 date and time for the next status update from Licensor; and 8 due dates for actions taken by Licensor, to the extent possible. h Licensor will provide regular status updates on the processing to Partner of Priority 1 \"Very High\" messages, which include: ® results of actions undertaken so far; ® next steps planned; and ® dale and time for next status update. - Licensor shall adhere to stated support policies and procedures that are made available through the SAP Knowledge Base for identifying and resolving security vulnerabilities. Note: A Corrective Action is a solution, work around or action plan for resolution supplied by Licensor. In the event an action plan is submitted to Partner as a Corrective Action, such action plan shall include: (i) status of the resolution process; (ii) planned next steps, including identifying responsible Licensor resources; (iii) required Partner actions to support the resolution process; (iv) to the extent possible, due dates for Licensor's actions; and (v) date and time for next status update from Licensor.

To this end, Partner must maintain the End User data required for SAP Support in the format made available by SAP within SAP Solution Manager Enterprise Edition, and update this data without delay. 10.10 The Incident processing system, automatically collects system data related to system error messages (for ex-ample, transaction code, program ID, Support Package level, Incident number). In its EULA with the End User, Partner must ensure that End User gives all consents required by law for this purpose, in particular under data protection law. 10.11 Furthermore, Partner must ensure in its EULA with the End User that Licensor is entitled to access the End User systems in order to render any support services. If required by applicable law, Partner must obtain written data protection consents from End Users. 10.12 Partner must specify in its support agreements with End Users that End Users will not send any Incidents directly to Licensor but will first contact Partners End User support. If after fulfilling its First and Second Level Support duties, Partner cannot solve the End User's problem related to the Software, Partner is entitled to forward the incident to SAP. 10.13 To leverage SAP Support Network, Partner must ensure that the communications connections between Partner and Licensor as well as between End Users and Licensor, which are necessary for remote support to be provided efficiently, are operable at all times and allow satisfactory response times, including without limitation implementation of SAP Solution Manager Enterprise Edition. This also covers the required communications connections to any third parties involved. Partner must bear the connection costs resulting from remote support. Licensor recommends that Partner uses the technologies for remote support specified on SAP Service Marketplace. -51- FIS Order Form No 1 FIS executab!e.docx SAP Opp. 301522588 \/ Quote 833204941 Case 3060322879 DocuSign Envelope ID: 7017F556-57AE-4011-B1B8-CA0EDC00AA6F 10.14 For satisfactory remote support, Partner must ensure that End User sets up an Internet connection and obtains a separate license for the relevant software if appropriate and required. 10.15 For Eligible Software, Partner must ensure that priority 1 (“very high”) Incidents are forwarded to Licensor also outside Local Office Times. Partner must inform End Users in its support agreements that Incidents related to Software forwarded directly to Licensor must be submitted in English. 10.16 To a reasonable extent, Partner must deploy the tools objectively suitable to solving the problems named in the Incident that Licensor makes available to Partner under this OEM Support Schedule at its own site and on End User systems in accordance with the current SAP Notes on SAP Service Marketplace. To deploy these tools, Partner must ensure that there is a functioning telecommunications connection between End User and Partner and between End User and Licensor. 10.17 In order to verify Partner's compliance with the terms of this OEM Support Schedule, Partner authorizes Licensor to periodically monitor and\/or audit (at least once annually and in accordance with Licensor standard procedures) (i) the correctness of the information provided by Partner and (ii) Partner’s use of SAP Solution Manager Enterprise Edition in accordance with the rights and restrictions set out in the Appendix \"Support Services” to this OEM Support Schedule. 10.18 Upon Licensor's request, Partner shall report to Licensor the total number of messages received (support Incidents related to Software) from End Users during a given period of time regardless of the communication channel through which the message was received.

TERMINATION 13.1 FIS may (without prejudice to its other rights or remedies) terminate this Agreement and\/or an SOW with immediate effect by written notice to the Supplier if: (a) the Supplier commits a material breach of this Agreement or an SOW that is not remediable or, if remediable, is not remedied within fourteen (14) days after being given notice to do so; (b) the Supplier commits repeated or persistent breaches of the same or similar provisions of this Agreement and\/or any SOW (as applicable) which by their repetition become material; (c) a Force Majeure Event persists for ten (10) consecutive Business Days, or fourteen (14) days in any thirty (30) day period; (d) an Insolvency Event occurs in relation to the Supplier; or (e) a change of Control occurs in relation to the Supplier. 13.2 Without prejudice to its other rights and remedies under this Agreement or in law, the Supplier may terminate this Agreement and\/or any relevant SOW immediately by notice in writing if: (a) FIS has failed to pay in full any undisputed amounts contained in an invoice from the Supplier within ninety (90) days of the due date of payment of such invoice provided that at least one written reminder notice has been delivered to FIS at least twenty-one (21) days prior to any such termination; (b) FIS commits a material breach of this Agreement or an SOW that is not remediable or, if remediable, is not remedied within fourteen (14) days after being given notice to do so; (c) FIS commits repeated or persistent breaches of the same or similar provisions of this Agreement and\/or any SOW (as applicable) which by their repetition become material; (d) a Force Majeure Event persists for ten (10) consecutive Business Days, or fourteen (14) days in any thirty (30) day period; (e) an Insolvency Event occurs in relation to FIS; or (f) 13.3 FIS may terminate this Agreement for convenience at any time by giving thirty (30) days' prior notice in writing provided that no SOW is in force; and (b) any SOW for convenience at any time by giving ten (10) Business Days' prior notice in writing to the Supplier and this Agreement and\/or the relevant Statement of Work shall terminate at the expiry of such notice, provided that upon such termination, FIS shall reimburse the Supplier for all work performed by Supplier as at the date that such notice of termination is served, and Supplier shall have no further obligation to perform any further works upon the service of such notice . 13.4 Upon termination or expiry of this Agreement or a relevant SOW, otherwise than for FIS's breach of its obligations under this Agreement, the Supplier shall: (a) transfer all Deliverables to FIS or its designated third party; (b) subject to agreeing in advance the Charges (if any) payable, based on the charges set out in Schedule 1 and\/or an applicable SOW: 13.4.b.1 provide all co-operation to FIS or its designated third party to enable the migration and transfer of the provision of the Services to FIS or to its designated third party without interruption or disruption and to facilitate the 11 DocuSign Envelope ID: D4BE64DD-DE44-4FD1-B218-C69C2683EA3C orderly transfer of the Services; and 13.4b.2 continue to provide the relevant Services for a period of no more than six (6) months after the relevant termination or expiry upon FIS's request. 13.5 If FIS terminates the Agreement or an SOW under clause 13.1(a) or 13.1(b), FIS shall not be obliged to pay any charges in connection with the Supplier's obligations set out in clause 13.4(b).2. 13.6 Upon termination of this Agreement all rights and obligations of any Party will cease to have effect immediately, save that the clauses and paragraphs which expressly or by implication have effect after termination will continue to be enforceable notwithstanding such termination (including clauses 5, 6, 7 through 12.3, 13, 14, 17, 19 to 21 and (as applicable) Schedules 6, 7 and 8); and termination will not affect accrued rights, obligations and liabilities of any Party under this Agreement as at the date of termination. 14.

For example, a monthly availability of 89.5% where the SLA is 99.5% would incur a penalty of a 10.0% credit of that month’s Monthly Fees. The credit shall be applied to the next month for which Customer is invoiced fees and in the event CA has breached such warranty in more than three months over a twelve month period, Customer shall also be entitled to terminate the subscription to the Hosted Services and obtain a refund of pre-paid, unused fees calculated against the remainder of the Subscription term as of the effective date of such termination.

This assessment shall include a logical assessment, penetration\/intrusion testing and\/or analysis services. Threats to CA system availability and review of whether attackers could deny legitimate users access to information made available through CA’s IT infrastructure may also be evaluated. Such periodic Assessments shall be at CA’s sole expense and shall be conducted by CA or a third party nationally recognized for performing such Assessments (a “VTA CA”). 12.9. Customer may also request that CA have the VTA CA conduct additional Assessments on an ad hoc basis, to provide reviews of CA’s infrastructure, applications, networks, internal scans, external scans and code. Such ad hoc Assessments shall be conducted in a manner that does not compromise CA’s reasonable security standards applicable to Customer, shall be conducted under CA’s direction, and shall be at Customer's sole expense. Customer shall have the right to require CA to use a different VTA CA (other than the one proposed by CA) to perform such additional ad hoc Assessments.

Security Breach. CA shall promptly notify Customer of (a) any actual or reasonably suspected (as determined by CA) unauthorized access to or acquisition, use, loss, destruction, alteration, compromise or disclosure of any unencrypted NPI, Customer Confidential Information, or Customer Data, or (b) any circumstance pursuant to which applicable law requires notification of such breach to be given to affected parties or other activity in response to such circumstance (each, a “Security Breach”). 12.13. In the event of a Security Breach, and subject to actions required by law enforcement, CA shall (i) promptly, but in no case more than 10 business days after CA confirms that the Security Breach affected Customer’s information, provide to Customer a detailed description of the incident, the data accessed, the identity of individuals or entities involved, if available, and such other information as Customer may reasonably request concerning the Security Breach; (ii) provide Customer with the name and contact information for an employee of CA who shall serve as CA’s primary security contact and shall be available to assist Customer as a contact in resolving obligations associated with the Security Breach; (iii) assist Customer in investigating, remedying and taking any other action Customer deems necessary regarding any Security Breach and any dispute, inquiry or claim that concerns the Security Breach; (iv) facilitate interviews with CA’s employees and third party service providers, such as computer security or forensic investigation firms assisting in responding to the Security Breach; (v) make available all relevant records, logs, files, report, and analysis regarding the Security Breach, as well as any other materials required to comply with applicable law, regulation, industry standards or as otherwise reasonably required by Customer; (vi) take prompt actions to ensure that such Security Breach or potential Security Breach will not recur; and (vii) cooperate with Customer and any law enforcement or regulatory official investigating such Security Breach.

If a notification to a Customer’s customer or users is required under any applicable law, then in addition to all other costs arising directly out of a Security Breach caused by CA’s failure to comply with the terms of this Agreement or the law, and without prejudice to all other rights and remedies available to Customer under this Agreement, at law or in equity, CA shall reimburse Customer for all reasonable notification related costs and other expenses as required by law incurred by Customer arising out of or in connection with any such Security Breach, including but not limited to, credit monitoring services reasonably required to remediate any damages. 12.14. To add clarity and avoid any doubt, the parties agree that the foregoing notice requirements do not apply (i) to unsuccessful security incidents where an “unsuccessful security incidents” means, without limitation, pings and other broadcast attacks on CA’s firewall, port scans, unsuccessful log-on attempts, denial of service attacks, and any combination of the above, so long as no such incident results in unauthorized access, use or disclosure of Customer Data, and (ii) if such use, acquisition or access to Customer Data was made in good faith and within the scope of authority or if after performing a thorough investigation, CA has a reasonable basis to believe that a person with unauthorized access would not have been able to retain the information. 13. Personnel. CA will assign personnel of appropriate education, qualifications, and experience to perform the Services in order to fulfill its obligations. CA personnel assigned to provide the Services shall at all times be deemed employed by CA. For any and all employees, representatives, agents or subcontractors that CA intends to perform the Services hereunder, CA shall be responsible, at its sole cost and expense, for conducting a background check in accordance with Customer’s Background Check Policy, attached hereto as Exhibit F. CA agrees that the background check shall be completed prior to the assignment of an individual to Customer’s account.

Vantiv can choose from one of the options listed below: 1. Data upload (DUT): a. Typically installed on the client side and uses XML file to upload data. b. Tool can be through a command line prompt or there are SDKs available to integrate into external system c. An additional encryption utility can be provided to encrypt data prior to upload 2. Arcot Upload Tool: a. This is the same as above but a graphical user interface rather than command line 3. Web Service: CA has web services available that Vantiv can use to delete data.\nTraining Included 8 hours of web based training is included in this proposal. For onsite training travel costs will be charged separately.\nPurely by way of example, if Vantiv decides to go with the following configuration for their migration: 2 Risk Based templates with Q&A; 2 Risk Based templates with Dynamic Passwords through SMS and 800 FI's to be migrated, then setup costs will be: ($25,000*2) + ($35,000*2) + $10,000 + (800*$100) = $210,000 Other one time fees will total $70,000 Notes: - This will be a one time setup fee for migrating the existing FI's on the Vantiv ACS to CA Hosted Service - To minimize the cost of implementation by FI a standard template will be built for both Risk Based Authentication with Dynamic Password by SMS and Risk Based Authentication with Knowledge Based Questions - CA will agree with Vantiv the approach for client onboarding but expect be implementing 800 FI’s in three segments; (1). Top 20 FI’s (2). Remaining 50% Portfolio (3). Last 50% of portfolio. - Client Onboarding of FI’s will be grouped to further minimize the cost per client. - Migration of transaction data is out of scope of this implementation cost - For CA OTP delivery, Vantiv may choose to use the CA partner gateway for SMS and Email. The CA solution can include integration with CA’s partner gateway for sending SMS. In such a scenario, a shared short code will be used in US and international delivery of SMS. For a custom SMS short code there will be an additional cost. CA Transaction Manager and Optional Services Agreement -18- CONFIDENTIAL DocuSign Envelope ID: 1AE341B1-219B-4D97-9F40-7615A4DB6599 - Costs detailed below cover the cost of implementation, template building project management and training. - FI is defined by ACRO. For example an FI with 2 ACRO's will be considered as 2 FI's on the CA system II. Data Uploads.

A As part of the agreement, Vantiv has agreed to pay certain minimum yearly fees that allow Vantiv 275 requests that can be applied towards changes in the categories listed in the table below. This arrangement will provide Vantiv with: 1. 275 change requests to use for items listed in the below table. 2. Delivery schedule for such changes must follow a quarterly implementation schedule to be agreed upon with Vantiv (“Quarterly Implementation Schedule”). 3. CA understands that the number of requests per quarter may vary so the 275 requests can be split across the 4 quarters as Vantiv sees fit. 4. CA will provide Vantiv with templates to request the changes. Vantiv will provide the changes in bulk using these templates. CA team will keep track of the number of change requests. 5. For changes beyond the 275 count, or for changes required outside of the Quarterly Implementation Schedule, CA standard list price applies and additional fees may apply as described in more detail in the table below. 6.

The current CA Hosted Solution supports the following card schemes: • Verified by Visa • MasterCard SecureCode • American Express SafeKey • Discover ProtectBuy • JCB J\/Secure In the hosted implementation of 3-D Secure, CA shall provide: • The hardware infrastructure to provide a 3-D Secure issuer service, including redundant components, cryptographic processors, servers, and network infrastructure. • The coordination of set-up and customization activities, including (as possible) the formalities required by the card schemes as part of the implementation. • All security arrangements for the solution, including physical access controls, network security, data security, and card scheme audit and security requirements. • All infrastructure to risk score the transaction in real time based on model or based on rules created by the client. I. CARDHOLDER AUTHENTICATION IMPLEMENTATION: CA will implement the issuer side of 3-D Secure thereby requiring that Cardholders authenticate themselves during an online transaction. An authentication failed message will be sent back to the merchant for cardholders unable to authenticate themselves. Authentication There are different authentication options available: Static Password: The cardholder is provided the option to authenticate by answering certain security questions (question to be finalized by the issuer). Examples of questions include but not limited to - date of birth, last 4 of SSN, mother’s maiden name etc. Once authenticated, the cardholder is requested to create a static password. Once done, a success message is sent back to the merchant. Any subsequent 3-D Secure transaction by the same card number will require just the static password to be entered. Passive Authentication: The cardholder is provided the option to authenticate by answering certain security questions (question to be finalized by the issuer). Examples of questions include but not limited to - date of birth, last 4 of SSN, mother’s maiden name etc. Once authenticated, a success CA Transaction Manager and Optional Services Agreement -39- CONFIDENTIAL DocuSign Envelope ID: 1AE341B1-219B-4D97-9F40-7615A4DB6599 message is sent back to the merchant. Do note that there is no static password created with this method. Any subsequent authentication required by the same card number will require answers to the security questions again. With both of the options above the answers to the security questions can be uploaded to the ACS by the issuer. Alternately, CA Hosted Solution has the ability to make real time calls to external systems to validate the answers. One Time Password (OTP): The cardholder is sent a One Time Password via an SMS to the mobile phone number available for that cardholder. Cardholder then has to enter that OTP on the shopping page displayed during the transaction. Once authenticated, a success message is sent back to the merchant. Issuer will ensure that mobile numbers for cardholders are uploaded and maintained on the CA Hosted ACS. Alternately, CA Hosted Solution has the ability to make real time calls to external systems to get the phone number. If the issuer so chooses, the OTP can also be sent to the cardholder’s email address as a backup method of delivery in case mobile is not available. Data Upload • Clients will complete an initial batch data upload; Subsequent files with changes and updates can be sent by the client as and when required • Data upload will follow the standardized CA process, policies and formats Risk Analytics If Risk Analytics is implemented then based on the risk score, the cardholder will be: • Transparently authenticated i.e. no authentication is required from the cardholder and a success message is sent to the merchant • Asked for additional authentication from the cardholder and depending on the final outcome a success or failed message is sent to the merchant • OR Deny the transaction. A failed message will be sent to the merchant II. SETUP: SETUP To facilitate the Set-Up, Customer shall be responsible for: • All necessary requirements (on the CA Issuer Set-Up Form and others as needed) • Any activities to be completed in a timely manner, as per the agreed project plan • All responses and decisions in a timely manner to avoid delays. • Issuer shall complete all necessary forms with the card schemes (CA shall assist with CA specific information as needed). CA Transaction Manager and Optional Services Agreement -40- CONFIDENTIAL DocuSign Envelope ID: 1AE341B1-219B-4D97-9F40-7615A4DB6599 As part of the Set-Up process, CA shall be responsible for: • Any development activities. • CA will also provide a test environment for client testing • All certification activities as required by the card schemes. If there are fees charged by the schemes for this certification then that will be paid by the customer • CA Administrative Console (for cardholder support and report access) • All production deployment activities • Post production monitoring ' A • CA Transaction Manager and Optional Services Agreement -41 - CONFIDENTIAL DocuSign Envelope ID: 1AE341B1-219B-4D97-9F40-7615A4DB6599 EXHIBIT F VANTIV Background Check Requirements Consultant shall be responsible for performing the background checks as listed below prior to assignment of a resource to perform Services for VANTIV.

Attachment 1 -A (as set forth in Amendment 2 to the Agreement, effective December 17, 2014) shall be amended as set forth in EXHIBIT A - Amendment to ATTACHMENT 1-A to the International Customer Purchase Agreement, attached hereto and fully incorporated by reference. 2. In all instances occurring within the Agreement, Customer’s legal entity shall be changed from “Fidelity Information Services” to “Fidelity Information Services, LLC.\" 3. The Supplemental Terms and Conditions attached hereto as EXHIBIT B (“Supplement”) are hereby incorporated into the Agreement. In the event of any conflict between the Supplement and any other part of the Agreement, the Supplement shall govern. 4. Sections 23 and 24 of the Agreement are hereby deleted in their entirety and replaced with the following: “23.1 Indemnity from Dell to Customer. Dell will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Customer from any third-party claim, demand, cause of action, debt or liability (including attorneys’ fees and expenses) (“Claim”) alleging (i) that the Dell-branded Products (as defined in Exhibit B to Amendment 3) infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate any Intellectual Property (patent, copyright or trademark) rights of a third party or other intellectual property rights enforceable in the country(ies) in which the Products are sold to Customer by Dell, or (ii) that the Products sold to Customer under this Agreement damage a third party to the extent such Claim is based on (1) Dell’s negligence or breach of representations and warranties in this Agreement, (2) failure of Dell to abide by all applicable laws, rules, regulations and orders that affect the Products, or (3) Dell’s failure to obtain any necessary rights and licenses to permit Dell to perform its obligations under this Agreement (an “Indemnified Claim\"). Dell will not indemnify Customer or bear any responsibility for any Claim arising from Customer's unauthorized modification of the Products that were not performed by or on behalf of Dell (to the extent such modification causes the alleged infringement), or from any combination, operation or use of the Products not performed by or on behalf of Dell, with other products or services (to the extent such combination, operation or use causes the alleged infringement). Dell will, at its expense and in its discretion, either (a) resolve the Indemnified Claim in above item (i) in a way that permits continued ownership and use of the affected Product; (b) provide a comparable non-infringing replacement Product at no cost to Customer; or (c) accept return of the Product freight collect and provide a depreciated refund for the Product based upon a straight-line schedule over a time period equal to the warranty period purchased with the Product. This Section is an exclusive statement of Dell’s liability and responsibility for Indemnified Claims and nothing in this Agreement or elsewhere will obligate Dell to provide any greater indemnity to Customer. 23.2 Indemnity from Customer to Dell. Customer will indemnify Dell from any Claim: (a) that Customer's modifications of and\/or additions to the Products after delivery to Customer (and also before delivery with respect to customizations not consisting solely of Dell-branded Products) infringe on, misappropriate or otherwise violate the Intellectual Property of a third party (to the extent the modifications and\/or additions causes the alleged infringement, misappropriation or violation); (b) that the Products sold to Customer under this Agreement damage a third party to the extent such Claim is based on (1) Customer’s misuse or abuse of the Products; (2) failure of Customer to abide by any laws, rules, regulations or orders governing Customer’s use of the Products, or (3) Customer’s failure to obtain any necessary rights and licenses to permit Dell to perform any Customer-requested customizations involving Third Party Products. 24. The obligation to indemnify under above Section 23 is contingent upon: (i) the indemnified party’s promptly notifying the indemnifying party in writing of any claim subject to such indemnity obligation; (ii) the indemnifying party’s having sole control over the defense and settlement of the claim; (iii) the indemnified party’s reasonably cooperating during defense and settlement efforts; (v) the indemnified party’s not making any admission, concession, consent judgment, default judgment or settlement of the claim or any part thereof. Except as provided herein, the above referenced Agreement and any amendments thereto remain unchanged and in full force and effect. In the case of a conflict between the terms of the Agreement and this Amendment, this Amendment shall take precedence over the Agreement.

The end date of the Special Pricing Term, as set forth in Section 2.A.2 of ATTACHMENT 1-A, shall be changed from January 15, 2018, to January 15, 2021. 2. The table in Section 2.A.2 which lists Customer’s Standard Configurations shall be deleted in its entirety and replaced with a new table as set forth below. Quotes for Standard Configurations are set forth in Attachment 1 to this Exhibit A. Model Description Quote # US.

Section 2.A.4 shall be deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following: Beginning in 2018, on or about February 1s' of each year (\"Year) during the Special Pricing Term, Dell will submit each then current Standard Configuration agreed upon by Customer and Dell to International Data Corporation (”IDC”) for competitive analysis. For these Standard Configurations, IDC will conduct a Smart Analysis which will establish the industry IDC Best in Class discounted price paid by similarly situated customers for the identical configuration from other Tier 1 Suppliers (the \"IDC Benchmark Price\") and Dell will compare Customer's pricing to the Benchmark Price. \"Tier 1 Supplier\" means Lenovo, HP, and Dell. Dell will bear the cost of obtaining the IDC Benchmark Price, which Customer may verify independently at its discretion and cost. Dell will provide the IDC Smart Analysis benchmark report to Customer. Example of IDC Smart Analysis report: iModel Dell List Price SI Price XXX Price List Discount SI Discount Peer Avg Best in Class 1\nDell Optiplex 3020 $843 $837 $534 37% 36% 34-37% 38-41%\nbell Latitude E5440 $1,362 $1,550 $779 43% 50% 45-48% 49-53% |\nNote: all peer discounting is based off the IDC Smartindex price During this annual review, if Dell's price to Customer for a Standard Configuration is found to be higher than the IDC Best in Class Benchmark Price, Dell will decrease the price for the affected Standard Configuration(s) for subsequent orders to the highest IDC Best in Class discount provided to similarly situated global enterprise customers, and the decreased price will remain in effect until further decreased under the procedure set out in this Section. Dell will cause IDC to complete the benchmark and Dell shall complete their review prior to April 1st of each year. Any Price changes resulting from the benchmarking process will become effective on the date Dell completes its review. Price changes under this Section will only apply to orders accepted by Dell after the effective date of the price change. The benchmarking set forth in this Section 2.A.7 is based on Customer’s commitment to retain Dell as its predominant global PC standard through the Special Pricing Term, except in the following situations (i) where Dell does not manufacture a competing PC product to address Customer’s business requirements (e.g., purchases of products like Microsoft Surface, Apple PC, Google Chrome, and\/or tablets); (ii) where Customer adds additional PC standard configuration to employee options and Dell declines to quote, at FIS contractual discounts, as part of a standard configuration (e.g., adding a lower-end PC standard configuration required for Customer purchases in countries like India, Brazil, and China having reduced labor costs); (iii) adding higher-end PC standard configuration for evolving development requirements; (iv) where Customer has difficulty imposing Customer’s PC policy in other countries; (v) Customer’s acquisition of new companies not using Dell PC’s; and (vi) where Customer encounters Dell PC product quality and service problems that the parties are unable to resolve after working together in good faith over a three month period. Customer agrees not to issue a request for proposal from other PC providers against the FIS\/Dell global PC standard prior to the expiration of the Special Pricing Term. 4. Section 2.A.5 shall be deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following: 3 Changes to Standard Configurations. No more than quarterly, Customer may request a change to any of the Standard Configurations and the new Standard Configuration will be priced as described herein.

Beginning on the Amendment 3 Effective Date, and continuing through the Special Pricing Term, and subject to the terms of the Agreement, this provision will apply with respect to Customer's applicable direct purchases from Dell in the U.S for Customer’s internal use. Dell will pay to Customer an incentive (“Incentive\") at the rate of one percent 4 (1 %) based on the total amount paid to Dell by Customer for Dell-branded Products in the previous Dell fiscal quarter (each a “Quarter\"), less: (i) sales and any other applicable taxes and shipping and handling charges; (ii) the price of Dell-branded Products returned to Dell for credit; and (iii) any amounts due and owing by Customer to Dell with respect to Dell invoices issued but unpaid as of the end of the relevant Quarter (“Quarterly Net Sales”). Such credit will be eligible for purchases of Dell-branded products, software or services within the U.S. that are used specifically for strategy, planning and innovation of new initiatives. Customer must use the Incentive within one (1) year of the Incentive’s accrual. 7. A new Section 2.F shall be added as follows: Servers, Storage and Network Maintenance\/Support. During the Special Pricing Term, Customer may buy Dell-branded servers, tape and storage maintenance\/support after the initial point of sale (“APOS\") at the following discounts off List Price. Where a Customer Affiliate located outside the U.S. orders maintenance\/support from the local Dell Affiliate, the price invoiced to the Customer Affiliate will be determined by adding the applicable regional uplift to the U.S. Dollar price for the relevant pricing. This price will then be converted to local currency. Taxes, shipping, and other applicable charges will be added to this price.\nServers 25%\nStorage Products 25%\nNetwork Products 25%\n8. Section 4 shall be deleted in its entirety and of no further force and effect. 9. A new Section 6 shall be added as follows: This Section 6 shall apply only to purchases made pursuant to Customer’s Data Center Consolidation Program in the U.S. (the “Program”) as set forth in the separately signed SOW entitled “FIS Datacenter Transformation & Consolidation Program\" (the “SOW\"). A. Sole Source Provider. The terms and pricing in this Section 6 are based on Customer’s agreement that Dell shall remain Customer’s sole vendor until completion of the Program, inclusive of all Dell proposed infrastructure in the “POD\" (Servers, Storage, and Networking, but not including laptops or backup infrastructure) and related Services described in the SOW (collectively “Dell Infrastructure”). For avoidance of doubt, this Section 6.A only applies to the replacement of Dell Infrastructure and Services in connection with the SOW, and not to any other servers, storage, networking, laptops or other equipment (collectively “Equipment”) or related services that FIS may desire to purchase or replace. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 6.A does not apply to any Equipment or related services that FIS may desire to purchase (i) in connection with FIS’s SunGard subsidiaries and divisions, or other entity acquired by FIS or its affiliates after the Effective Date, (ii) as a result of FIS applications or infrastructure (a) not being compatible with Dell's in-scope hardware (provided that FIS will consult with Dell before making any such determination of incompatibility), or (b) requiring any proprietary compute, storage or network solution of configuration outside the Dell infrastructure POD. B. Servers, Storage, and Networking Products. During the term of the Data Center Consolidation Program set forth in a separately signed SOW (the “DCC Pricing Term”), Customer and Customer Affiliates may purchase from Dell and Dell Affiliates the following Standard Configurations at the fixed prices set forth in the quotes described below and in Attachment 1 to this Exhibit A. The quotes set forth below include 5-year warranty support plus an additional 6th and 7th year of warranty support for both the Dell hardware and the Nutanix software tied to the Dell hardware. Where a Customer Affiliate located outside the U.S. orders a Standard Configuration from the local Dell Affiliate, the price invoiced to the Customer Affiliate will be determined by adding the applicable regional uplift as set forth in Attachment 2 to the U.S. Dollar price for the relevant Standard Configuration. This price will then be converted to local currency. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, shipping charges for each server, storage, and networking product shall not exceed $25 per unit.

If a Standard Configuration reaches the end of its life cycle (“EOL\") during the Special Pricing Term, Dell will work with Customer to develop a plan for a smooth transition to a new Standard Configuration from the same category of Dell system with no less material functionality than the original Standard Configuration (based on like-for-like comparison) at a point in the product life cycle where the price of the new Standard Configuration is same price as that of the Standard Configuration that has reached EOL D. On-site Parts Program. Dell will provide replenishment parts for an On-Site Parts Program at three Customer data centers (Arkansas, Milwaukee, and Arizona). Customer shall be obligated to pay for fifty percent (50%) of the quoted price of this program, not to exceed $125,000. FIS badged employees (Dell certified technicians) will be removing parts from the locker. Dell will be responsible for providing replenishment parts. E.

G. VM Compression. In the event that the provided attainable compression ratio (42:1) per host, on average cannot be achieved based on the FIS defined VM profile of 2vCPUs, 8GB RAM, 200GB HDD, Dell will be responsible for any additional platform hardware required to accommodate the workload (exceptions if overall workload count\/servers significantly change). Other VM profiles will be optimized as appropriate to meet business objectives. H. Nutanix Support. Dell will remain the primary point of contact during the warranty period for purchased systems\/platform. After the warranty period, Dell will use commercially reasonable efforts to continue to provide phone support, parts and solutions for an additional period totaling at least for seven years after the system purchase. Dell’s provision of maintenance and support services (including that for Nutanix software) will be in accordance with, then existing support agreements and Dell will provide FIS with six (6) months’ notice in the event Nutanix software becomes unavailable for resale by Dell to FIS. Should Dell not be able to provide the same level of support and maintenance for the Nutanix software as delivered prior to any such notice, Dell will acquire such support from Nutanix, at the level necessary to cover the purchased systems under warranty, for the remainder of the warranty period and transfer it to FIS at no additional cost to FIS. I. Training and Certification Support. Dell will recommend and arrange for a training program to have six (6) FIS employees prepared for NPX Certification. Such training will be either in person (at up to three (3) FIS locations for multiple simultaneous trainees) or self-paced online training courses plus certification test fees (including at least one re¬ test per FIS resource) for: • Nutanix support specialist (NSS) certifications for OPs • Nutanix platform professional (NPP) certifications for OPs • Nutanix platform professional (NPP) certifications for Engineering J. Data Center Consolidation Delivery Time Frame. (i) Dell will deliver all Products within a reasonable time period and no later than 30 days after receipt of an order from FIS (each a “Delivery Deadline”), unless otherwise agreed in writing by the parties. Dell recognizes that the Program includes timelines for the installation and configuration of Dell Products, and will notify Customer within three (3) business days of any delays in the delivery of Products beyond the respective Delivery Deadlines. Upon such notification, the parties agree to meet and discuss acceptable solutions. If no acceptable solution has been agreed upon within seven (7) business days from Dell’s receipt of an Order, then notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, Customer shall be entitled to cancel the applicable Order. If the applicable Order is cancelled within seven (7) business days pursuant to this Section, Customer may purchase a similar product from a third party in place of the cancelled Product Order. If a cancelled order is delivered in error, Customer may return 6 such Product to Dell without charge, freight collect. In the event Customer purchases a third-party product pursuant to this Section, (i) Dell shall have no liability for such third party product’s functionality within the POD or the Program; (ii) Dell shall not be responsible for configuration services for PODs containing non-Dell branded servers, network, and\/or storage; and (iii) the Shortfall Amount (as defined in below Section 9.L) shall be reduced by the amount of any such purchases. (ii) Dell is responsible for all Product planning and delivery for the Program, and Dell is responsible for ensuring that the timing of all Product deployment conforms to the timelines and objectives for the Program as described in the SOW. Dell will provide FIS at least 3 weeks' prior written notice of the date that FIS will be required to place each Product order proposed by Dell under the Program, to give FIS sufficient time to review and approve each proposed order. (iii) Dell has informed FIS that the delivery of Products containing SSD\/SED drives could take up to 63 days. Notwithstanding the first sentence of above Section J(i), the Delivery Deadline with respect to Products containing SSD\/SED drives will be 63 days after receipt of an order. For all Product orders containing SSD\/SED drives, Dell take shall take into account the up to 63 day delivery period when determining when to provide the 3 week notice to FIS as required by the preceding Section J(ii), with the understanding and agreement that such extended delivery period does not limit or affect Dell’s continuing obligation to meet the timelines and objectives in the SOW. Warranty Support Services. As part of the Program, Dell will be installing, configuring, testing and migrating applications (“Deployment and Configuration Services”) onto certain Dell-branded Products purchased by FIS under the Agreement, to make such Products ready for FIS’ functional use (“Placement Into Service”). For avoidance of doubt, the products that FIS is purchasing from Dell pursuant to this Agreement in connection with the Services being provided under the SOW, are all Dell-branded products and include embedded Nutanix software at the time of delivery by Dell. Each Product will undergo Deployment and Configuration Services performed by Dell personnel pursuant to the SOW, between the date that the Products are delivered to FIS until the earlier of (i) the date that Placement Into Service occurs (the “Placement Into Service Date”), or (ii) 24 months following the effective date of the Product shipment date (“Product Shipment Date\"). Warranty Support Services for the Products shall commence at the earlier of: (a) the Placement Into Service Date, or (b) 24 months plus one day from the Product Shipment Date. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the term of Warranty Support Services for all such Products shall commence on the Product Shipment Date and shall expire at the end of the seventh (7th) year from the Product Shipment Date. Nothing herein limits or affects Dell’s obligation to promptly correct any defects or malfunctions caused by Dell’s improper performance of the Deployment and Configuration Services. Expected Infrastructure Spend for the Program. Customer expects to spend $18,923,280 on Dell infrastructure for the Program (“Expected Spend\"), and the Expected Spend as reduced by all taxes and shipping charges on the infrastructure purchased is referred to herein as the “Net Spend\". If the amount of the Dell-branded hardware and software purchased under the Program is less than the Net Spend (“Actual Spend\"), Customer agrees, within one year after the last infrastructure purchase under the Program, to purchase anywhere in the world additional Dell products having an aggregate total purchase price at least equal to the difference between the Net Spend and the Actual Spend (“Shortfall Amount\") and consisting of any or all the following: servers, hyper converged solutions, storage, networking and related services pertaining to the implementation and support of any of the foregoing products. For avoidance of doubt, the Shortfall Amount will not be reduced by any purchases of (i) PC’s, or (ii) third party software or hardware that is not specifically Dell-branded. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Shortfall Amount will be reduced by any third-party product purchases by Customer as described in above Section 9.J. Further notwithstanding the foregoing, if FIS in its sole discretion awards a contract to Dell in connection with FIS’s Request for Proposal UK Data Centre Optimization Services dated November 2, 2016 (“UK DCC RFP”), Dell has agreed to reduce the final negotiated price in the SOW for such services (“UK DCC SOW\") by $286,000, and in that event the Expected Spend under this Agreement will automatically increase to $19,209,280 if and when the parties execute a UK DCC SOW that includes such price decrease. Nothing herein commits FIS to enter into any contract negotiations with Dell in connection with the UK DCC RFP, or execute any SOW or other contract related to the UK DCC RFP. 7 ATTACHMENT 1 to Exhibit A Customer’s quotes for Standard Configurations are set forth below: Quote #: 733358963 1 QUANTITY I SYSTEM PRICE ^432 uu GROUP TOTAL I Mm I Description Quantity |\n[OptiPlex 5040 Mini Tower XCTO (210-AFID) 1 !\n4GB (1 x4G) 1600MHz DDR3L Memory, Dell OptiPlex (370-ACHU) 1 t\nDell KB216 Wired Multi-Media Keyboard English Black (580-ADJC) 1 I\nIntel Integrated Graphics, Dell OptiPlex (490-BBFG) 1 I\nNo Wireless (555-BBFO) 1\n3.5 inch 500GB 7200rpm Hard Disk Drive (400-AANO) 1 !\nNo Media Card Reader (385-BBCR) 1 [\nMicrosoft Office 30 Day Trial (658-BCSB) 1 i\n[Dell Data Protection System Tools Digital Delivery\/DT (422-0008) 1 I\n[Adobe Reader 11 (640-BBDF) 1\n[Dell Data Protection | Protected Workspace (640-BBEV) [Dell(TM) Digital Delivery Cirrus Client (640-BBLW) _1_ 1 !\n[Enable Low Power Mode (658-BBMQ) 1 |\n[Dell Client System Update (Updates latest Dell Recommended BIOS, Drivers, Firmware and |Apps),OptiPlex (658-BBMR) 1\n[Waves Maxx Audio (658-BBNH) |MY DELL (658-BBVM)__ [Dell Developed Recovery Environment (658-BCUV) 1 _J j\n[Windows 7 Pro English, French, Spanish 64bit (Includes Windows 10 Pro License) (619-AIKN) 1 I\n(US Order (332-1286) 1 [\n[OptiPlex 5040 MT with 240W up to 85% efficient Power Supply (SOPIus Bronze) (329-BCRT) 1 i\n[Dell MS116 Wired Mouse, Black (275-BBBW) 1\n[ENERGY STAR Version 6.0 (387-BBEZ) 1\nDVD+\/-RW Bezel (325-BBRL) 1\nTray load DVD Drive (Reads and Writes to DVD\/CD) (429-AAJV) 1\nNo Wireless (555-BBFO) ~ T'l\nSystem Power Cord (Philipine\/TH\/US) (450-AAOJ) [windows 10 Pro OS Recovery 64bit - DVD (620-AAYW) [Desktop BTO Standard shipment (800-BBIO) [Not Selected in this Configuration (817-BBBC) [Safety\/Environment and Regulatory Guide (English\/French\/Dutch) (340-AGIK) |Dell Limited Hardware Warranty Plus Service (997-8533)_ [Onsite\/ln-Home Service After Remote Diagnosis 3 Years (997-8535) jNo UPC Label (389-BCGW)_ 'TPM Enabled (329-BBJL)_ _ __ jNo Special BIOS Setup Required (696-BBBC) jIntel Standard Manageability (631-AASS) (Display Not Included (480-AAJX) [No Diagnostic\/Recovery CD media (340-ABJI) [No Quick Reference Guide (340-ABKW) jlntel Core i3-6100 Processor (Dual Core, 3MB, 4T, 3.7GHz, 65W) (338-BHUE) ?Mini Tower Processor Heatsink 65 Watt (412-AAGU) bNo DOPE Encryption Software (954-3465) --ynTrrnjTTnj J_LLjJJ JJ IJJ_LU J\n8 Shipping Material for System, Minitower, DAO (340-ARRJ) 1\nShipping Label for DAO (389-BBUU) 1\nNo FGA (817-BBBB) 1\nNo Adapter (450-ABBX) 1\nDell Data Protection | Endpoint Security Suite Enterprise, 3 yr (525-0062) 1\nProSupport for Dell Data Protection Endpoint Security Suite Enterprise, 3 Years (807-9602) 1\nPowerDVD Software not included (632-BBBJ) 1\n2nd Hard Drive: not included (401-AANH) —J_I 1\n^Regulatory Label (389-BHKN)\nNo CompuTrace (461-AABF) 1\nNo Intel Responsive (551-BBBJ) 1\nIntel Core i3 Label (389-BHGC) 1\nGCP PM Support (Per Box) Gold (929-8509) Quote #: 733359254 ?

Renewal Total $27,309.47 All pricing in US Dollars 28 Attachment 2 to Exhibit A Regional Pricing Uplifts Q4 FY2017 I. GENERAL DEFINITION Regional pricing uplifts are added to Dell's global standard price for products, services, and software available from Dell (collectively “Products\") to offset incremental costs incurred by Dell in providing Products in certain countries or regions. Uplifts are not intended to enhance Dell's margins, and the application of regional uplifts is a world-wide industry standard. Pricing uplifts arc subject to change without prior notice due to ongoing changes in the business and regulatory environments. Uplift charges are calculated on a country and Product-specific basis anil arc added to the unit price for the relevant Product. Regional uplifts do not cover the following charges: • freight from manufacture facility to customer's site • local taxes such as the value added tax (VAT) or the goods tax (GT) • export\/import duties and tariffs on finished Products • currency conversions\/hedge rates II. PURCHASES IN DELL DIRECT COUNTRIES General regional uplift The following uplifts are applied to Dell's global standard prices for Products purchased directly from Dell’s local entity (each a “Dell Affiliate\") in the countries and regions listed below. No additional uplift is charged for the US and EMEA Direct countries. Please sec below for additional explanations. Brazil: 0'4 for imported monitors * India: for U.S S transacted shipments to India, extra charges apply on top of the Direct uplift. See details below.

Americas (other than US and Canada): Uplift is applied on all Products and warranty upgrades. Uplift covers incremental labor and logistics costs to support the Product warranty, such as larger inventory of service parts and warehousing requirements, custom clearance administration fees and import duties on replacement pans. Americas Hybrid Countries- When purchasing in Dell Hybrid countries- also known as \"hybrid\". GCP customers have the option of using a Direct Dell sales model or a Partner sales model.

Uplift Applies Partner uplift applies\nImport to Destination Country Responsibility of customer Responsibility of Panner\n29 Brazil: Uplift is applied on all Products and warranty upgrades. Uplifts are considerably different based on manufacture location. Locally manufactured products: products manufactured in Brazil arc subject to higher uplifts due to higher labor\/logistics infrastructure costs, higher cost of manufacturing components and higher warranty costs. Uplifts do not include freight and duties ( when applicable). Using local components allows Dell to have lower sales (excise) taxes that translate as a lower landed price to the customer. Imported products: for imported products Dell charges lower uplifts, which cover warranty costs. Import fees, inbound freight and sales taxes are paid directly by the customer, not by Dell, so the uplift paid to Dell is lower. Sales taxes for imported equipment are fully charged by the government to the customer, without the sales (excise) tax benefit of locally built equipment. While the Dell uplifts alone arc lower for imported products, the final landed price of imported products is ultimately higher.

PURCHASES IN PARTNER-LED COUNTRIES AND FROM RESELLERS 2 Dell uses distributors and resellers to deliver products and provide services to countries where Dell has no direct corporate presence. These countries arc referred to as “Partner Led Countries”. In Partner Led Countries Dell recommends DASP (Dell Authorized Service Providers) where available. Where customers purchase Products in Partner Led Countries or otherwise buy from a reseller or distributor and not directly from Dell, the final price and terms for purchases from distributors and resellers are determined by the distributor or reseller and legally these prices cannot be dictated by Dell. Distributors may offer additional services, with pricing for these services to be negotiated directly between the customer and the distributor. Products purchased in Partner-led Countries are subject to country availability. ln<hiiiiit< 1 plii l 1 ••uni ih •• \\iiu in .i*\nAll LOB'S 10.16% 5% 12.35% 10.25%\nPhilippines, Vietnam and Pakistan: Sec below for additional DASP charges.

To the extent the following restrictions are not prohibited by law, without prior written consent of the other party, neither party will, directly or indirectly, solicit for employment, or hire or otherwise retain the services of any employee of the other party who was involved in the performance of Services under this Agreement during the preceding 12 months. This prohibition on soliciting and hiring shall extend for 90 days after the termination of the employee’s employment if such employee voluntarily resigns. Additionally, Provider shall not induce or influence any Client to terminate or curtail its relationship with FIS. The foregoing shall not apply to (i) the publication of classified advertisements in newspapers, periodicals, Internet bulletin boards, or other publications of general availability or circulation, or (ii) a solicitation that targets individuals with particular work experience or skills based on information available to subscribers, members or the general public on professional or social network websites or job boards, nor shall the consideration and hiring of persons responding to such advertisements or solicitation be deemed a breach of this Section, unless the advertisement, solicitation or other recruiting activity is undertaken as a means to circumvent or conceal a violation of this provision. c. ONGOING QUALIFICATION OF PROVIDER (1) Provider will keep complete, accurate, and up-to-date books and records in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and sound business practices covering all transactions relating to the Agreement. d. COMPLIANCE WITH LAW. (1) In all circumstances, each Party, at its own expense, will comply with all applicable laws, orders and regulations of any governmental authority with jurisdiction over its activities in connection with this Agreement. Provider will identify and procure all permits, certificates, approvals, licenses, and inspections necessary for Provider’s performance under the Agreement other than such permits, certificates, approvals, licenses and inspections that FIS is directly responsible for obtaining under the Agreement. (2) Non-Discrimination and Affirmative Action: Unless exempt, Provider will abide by the requirements of 41 CFR §§ 60- 1.4(a), 60-300.5(a), and 60-741.5(a). These regulations prohibit discrimination against qualified individuals based on their status as protected veterans or individuals with disabilities, and prohibit discrimination against all individuals based on their race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender-identification or national origin. Moreover, these regulations require that covered prime contractors and subcontractors take affirmative action to employ and advance in employment individuals without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender-identification, national origin, protected veteran status or disability. If applicable, Provider and its subcontractors will also abide by the requirements of 41 CFR § 61-300.10 regarding veterans’ employment reports and the provisions of 29 CFR Part 471, Appendix A to Subpart A regarding posting notice of employee rights. (3) Sexual Harassment. Provider will promptly notify FIS upon receipt of a complaint regarding the alleged occurrence of any sexual or other harassment incidents, either by or directed at any Provider Personnel, and the parties, where appropriate, will cooperate in investigating said complaint and where necessary take remedial action. Provider represents that Provider has and will continue to maintain anti-harassment policies covering all Provider Personnel in conformity with applicable federal, state and local Laws. In the event of any claim or legal proceeding relating to a sexual or other harassment incident involving Provider Personnel, the parties will, where appropriate, cooperate with each other in resolving such claim or legal proceeding. For avoidance of doubt, this subsection (3) applies only in connection with Providers performance of any Services under the Agreement. 36 e. USE OF FIS OR CLIENT NAMES. Neither party will use the other party’s names, logos, trademarks or stock exchange ticker symbol, or in connection with the Agreement, as to Provider, those of any Client, unless pre-approved in writing by the other party. Neither party will make any press release or other similar communication that mentions or implies a relationship between Provider and FIS, or between Provider and a Client in connection with the Agreement, unless pre¬ approved in writing by the other party. f. WARRANTIES (1) Provider represents and warrants that it has full right and authority to perform its obligations and grant the rights and licenses granted under the Agreement, and will continue to maintain such full right and authority throughout the Term. g. GENERAL TERMS (1) Provider represents and warrants that Provider will not knowingly install, use, or execute any Destructive Elements on any Products in the course of providing Products or related Services under this Agreement, and Dell will use commercially reasonable efforts (including without limitation software scans) to detect and remove such Destructive Elements from software or hardware provided by Dell under this Agreement, but only to the extent such Destructive Elements were introduced prior to shipment of such software or hardware to FIS. (2) Each Party agrees that neither the execution and delivery of the Agreement nor the other documents and instruments to be executed and delivered under the Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement will (i) violate any Law, including injunction or decree of any court, (ii) require any action by either Party to obtain or give any authorization, consent, approval, exemption or other action by or notice to any court, administrative or governmental agency, instrumentality, commission, authority, board or body (or if so required, the relevant Party has taken all such actions and obtained all needed and necessary authorizations, consents, approvals, and exemptions), or (iii) violate or conflict with, or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default) under, any term or provision of a Party’s charter or bylaws or any contract, license, or legal restriction of any kind or character to which a Party is a party or by which a Party or any of its assets or properties may be bound or affected. (3) Each Party agrees that, to the best of its knowledge, that (i) there is no action, suit, arbitration proceeding, investigation or inquiry pending or threatened against it, its business or any of its assets that would affect its ability to perform its obligations under the Agreement, and (ii) that it does not know or have grounds to know, of any basis for any such actions, suits, arbitrations, proceedings, investigations or inquiries, that would affect its ability to perform its obligations under the Agreement. (4) Provider agrees to maintain an adequate and trained staff of employees and adequate and proper facilities, resources and systems in order to perform the Services to FIS at agreed upon service levels pursuant to the Agreement. h. INSURANCE. The Insurance Requirements attachment to this Supplement sets forth minimum amounts of certain types of insurance coverage and other requirements relating to such insurance and is part of the Agreement. Provider will maintain such insurance and comply with such other obligations during the Term, at its own expense. i. BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLAN AND DISASTER RECOVERY. Provider will establish and maintain disaster recovery and business continuity plans designed to minimize the risks associated with a disaster affecting Provider’s ability to provide the Services, which includes off-site data storage and recovery infrastructure.

The foregoing definition does not include any software or device that enables Provider to access FIS systems to make repairs required under an agreement with FIS. PART 8. ASSIGNABILITY. Either party may, without consent or notice, assign the Agreement to an Affiliate or pursuant to any merger or acquisition of all or substantially all of its assets, provided such assignee has adequate financial resources to stand behind the obligations under this Agreement.

Assignor represents and warrants to Assignee that as of the Effective Date there have been no amendments or modifications to or waivers of the Contract which have not been supplied and identified by the Assignor to the Assignee and that the form and content of the Contract is as supplied and identified by Assignor to Assignee. 3. Acceptance of Assignment. Assignee accepts such assignment and agrees to be liable for any obligations or liabilities that arise or accrue under the Contract relating to Assignee as of the Effective Date. 4. Miscellaneous.

(b) This Assignment reflects the entire agreement and understanding between the parties with respect to the assignment contemplated herein, supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements, arrangements, understandings, communications, representations or warranties, both oral and written, related to the Contract. This Assignment may be modified or waived, in whole or in part, only by a written document signed by all parties. (c) No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right, power, or privilege under this Assignment will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder. (d) The parties each covenant and agree to execute, to acknowledge and to deliver, at their own expense, such other instruments and to take such other actions as may be reasonably required to effectuate this Assignment whenever and so often as reasonably required so to do by the parties hereto, their successors and assigns. (e) Failure by any party to enforce at any time any of the terms and conditions of this Assignment will not be considered a waiver of that party's right to enforce such terms and conditions.

Neither Worldpay nor its Users acquire under this Agreement any right or license to use the Cloud Services in excess of the scope and\/or duration of the Cloud Services stated herein and in the applicable Order Form. 4.3 Standard Cloud Services; Cloud Services Add-Ons. Standard Cloud Services purchased by Worldpay in an Order Form will entitle the Worldpay to receive the features, service levels or other benefits set forth in Schedule 1 attached hereto. If Worldpay desires to obtain certain additional features, service levels or other benefits with respect to the Cloud Services not provided under the standard Cloud Services purchased by Worldpay, Supplier offers, from time to time, additional Cloud Services Add-Ons that Worldpay may purchase separately in an Order Form. Additional terms and conditions covering such Cloud Services Add-Ons are covered in the applicable Order Form for such Cloud Services Add¬ Ons. 4.4 Acceptable Use Policy. Worldpay shall not sublicense, license, sell, lease, rent or otherwise make the Cloud Services available to third parties. However, Worldpay may allow its Affiliates, partners, agents, or independent service providers who use Worldpay Systems to be Users (\"Third Party Users”) of the Cloud Services through the Worldpay System up to the Authorized Use Limitation, and may charge such Third Party Users for such use), provided that nothing contained in the foregoing is intended to permit Worldpay to resell the Cloud Services as a standalone service to third parties in competition with eGain. When using the Cloud Services, Worldpay shall not, and shall ensure that Users (including without limitation, any Third Pary Users) do not (collectively, \"Acceptable Use Policy”): (a) copy, translate, disassemble, decompile, reverse-engineer or otherwise modify any parts of the Cloud Services; (b) knowingly transmit any content, data or information that is unlawful, abusive, malicious, harassing, tortious, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, libelous, invasive of another's privacy right or right of publicity, or racially or ethnically objectionable; (c) knowingly infringe the intellectual property rights of any entity or person; (d) knowingly interfere with or disrupt the Supplier software or Supplier systems used to provide the Cloud Services, or other equipment or networks connected to the Cloud Services; (e) use the Cloud Services in the operation of a service bureau, outsourcing or time-sharing service; (f) circumvent or disclose, other than in accordance with audit compliance or as required by law, the user authentication or security of the Cloud Services or any host, network, or account related thereto; (g) access the Cloud Services for the purpose of building a competitive product or service or copying its features or user interface; (h) knowingly store or transmit \"SPAM” (defined as unsolicited commercial email or \"Malicious Code” (defined as viruses, worms, time bombs, Trojan horses, and other harmful or malicious code, files, scripts, agents or programs); (i) attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Cloud Services or their related systems or networks; (j) make any use of the Cloud Services that violates any applicable local, state, national, international or foreign law or regulation; (l) perform any penetration testing or vulnerability assessment\/scanning on the production or non-production servers without purchasing the required On Demand Scan Cloud Add On and prior written approval from Supplier; (m) perform activities that may result in URL to become blacklisted; (n) perform any denial of service attacks (DDOS) activities to any part of the platform; (o) perform system or URL load testing. Worldpay shall use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized access to or use of the Cloud Service and notify Supplier promptly of any such unauthorized access or use. Worldpay shall be responsible for Users' compliance with this Agreement. 6 con-12255 DocuSign Envelope ID: A7DB720C-2208-4C7F-9FF7-1CCEBC228DB3 4.5 Modifications to Cloud Services. Supplier reserves the right to make modifications to the Cloud Services or particular features or components of the Cloud Services, from time to time, at its sole discretion. Supplier will provide Worldpay at least 90 days prior written Notice of any such material modifications to the purchased Cloud Services. 4.6 Bots. Where applicable, Worldpay expressly acknowledges and agrees to the following: • The out-of-the-box default for Supplier Cloud Services products in the Supplier Cloud Services is to not allow access to the Supplier web self¬ service site by any Bots; • Worldpay may request Supplier to allow access to the Supplier web self¬ service site by well-behaved Bots; and • All Sessions (Identified Bot Sessions, Unidentified Bot Sessions and Regular Sessions) will be licensed and billed at the same rate. The following definitions apply to this Clause 4.6: \"Bot(s)” means software applications that run automated tasks over the Internet. As used in this Agreement, all reference to Bots refers to well behaved Bots. A well-behaved Bot identifies itself as a Bot in the http request header; \"Identified Bot Session” means a Session initiated by a well -behaved Bot; \"Unidentified Bot Session” means a Session initiated by a bot that is not well behaved; 4.7 Sessions. Where applicable, Worldpay expressly acknowledges and agrees to the following: \"Session” means the period of time a User uses the Cloud Services product. The Session begins when the User first interacts with the Cloud Service product and ends either (a) when the User ends the use of the Cloud Services product, or (b) there is a Timeout. A Session may either be authenticated or unauthenticated. A \"Session” may involve an \"Agent Session” or a \"Customer Self Service Session”. The following additional definitions shall also apply with respect to the use of a Session: o \"Timeout” means an expired time limit for a logged in User which has been inactive for the Timeout Period. o \"Timeout Period” means a time window configurable in the Cloud Services product. Different default Timeout Periods may apply. o \"Agent User” means a person at a Worldpay's contact center who interacts with customers via phone, email or chat, in order to fulfill customer requirements and who uses or accesses any Cloud Services product, other than other any Supplier's Customer Self Service cloud products. o \"Agent Session” means with a Session commenced by a unique and identified Agent User (may be a concurrent User or a named Agent User) in any Cloud Services product, other than in any Supplier's Customer Self Service cloud products. The default Timeout Period for an Agent Session is set to fifteen (15) minutes, and in no event will a Timeout Period for an Agent Session be less than fifteen (15) minutes. o \"Enterprise Session” means a Session commenced by a non-contact center employee of the Worldpay's business using the self service capability in the Cloud Services products. • The default Timeout Period for an Enterprise Session is set to five (5) minutes, and in no event will a Timeout Period for an Enterprise Session be less than five (5) minutes. • For billing purposes, each Enterprise Session will be calculated based on the occurrence of the number of EnterpriseSession Billable Units. Each \"Enterprise Session Billable Unit” means an Enterprise Session of up to ten (10) minutes. If an Enterprise Session is opened for more than ten (10) minutes, then it will be counted as multiple Enterprise Sessions. If an Enterprise Session is opened for less than ten (10) minutes, then it will be con-12255 7 DocuSign Envelope ID: A7DB720C-2208-4C7F-9FF7-1CCEBC228DB3 counted as one (1) Enterprise Session. For example, if a User logs into an Enterprise Session for seven (7) minutes, Worldpay will be deemed to have used one (1) Enterprise Session Billable Unit; if a User logs into an Enterprise Session for fifteen (15) minutes, Customer will be deemed to have used two (2) Enterprise Session Billable Units; and if a User logs into an Enterprise Session for twenty-three (23) minutes, Worldpay will be deemed to have used three (3) Enterprise Session Billable Units. o \"Customer Self-Service Session” means a Session commenced by a User using any of Supplier's Customer Self Service cloud products (e.g. \"Web Self Service”, \"Virtual Assistant”, etc.). • The default Timeout Period for a Customer Self Service Session is set to five (5) minutes, and in no event will a Timeout Period for a Customer Self Service Session be less than five (5) minutes. • For billing purposes, Worldpay's use of any Customer Self Service cloud product will be calculated based on the occurrence of the number of Customer Self Service Session Billable Units. Each \"Customer Self¬ Service Session Billable Unit” means a Customer Self Service Session of up to ten (10) minutes. If a Customer Self Service Session is opened for more than ten (10) minutes, then it will be counted as multiple Customer Self Service Sessions. If a Customer Self Service Session is opened for less than ten (10) minutes, then it will be counted as one (1) Customer Self Service Session. For example, if a User logs into a Customer Self Service Session for seven (7) minutes, Worldpay will be deemed to have used one (1) Customer Self Service Billable Unit; if a User logs into a Customer Self Service Session for fifteen (15) minutes, Worldpay will be deemed to have used two (2) Customer Self Service Session Billable Units; and if a User logs into a Customer Self Service Session for twenty-three (23) minutes, Worldpay will be deemed to have used three (3) Customer Self Service Session Billable Units. • Worldpay further acknowledges as follows: • Customer Self Service Sessions are linked to a Customer Self Service portal which can either be set up as an internal (agent¬ facing) portal or an external (customer or third party facing) portal. Accessing such Customer Self Service portal directly or via APIs will be deemed to consume a Session. • Agent-facing portals must be set up to restrict anonymous access and agents must be uniquely identified to access such portal and anonymous API calls may not be used in agent-facing scenarios. • If the Worldpay utilizes any third-party solutions that access the Customer Self Service Sessions, Worldpay must ensure that such third-party system has been configured not to allow for 'Multiplexing'. The term \"Multiplexing” as used herein shall mean the use of the third-party system to 'pass through' requests, cache them or apply any other method to reduce the Session consumption on the system. Examples of multiplexing include, without limitation: (a) using Supplier APIs to routinely extract knowledge data to create a mirrored site on a non-Supplier system which is open for general access; (b) using Supplier APIs to cache requests for reuse across multiple requests without requiring a unique Session for each User; (c) using a single Session in a third-party solution and continually recycling a single Session to serve multiple Users' Sessions. 8 con-12255 DocuSign Envelope ID: A7DB720C-2208-4C7F-9FF7-1CCEBC228DB3 4.8 Service Levels and Cloud Support. Unless Worldpay has purchased any Cloud Add-Ons in an Order Form which modifies the service levels, the applicable service levels for the Cloud Services are as described in Supplier's then-current standard Worldpay Support Policy for Cloud Installations which is made available by Supplier to Worldpay upon request (\"Cloud Support Policy”) and which is incorporated into this Agreement. Furthermore, provided that Worldpay is current on payment of the applicable fees for Cloud Services and Cloud Support, Supplier's provision of maintenance and support services for such Cloud Services (\"Cloud Support”) is as set forth in Supplier's then-current standard Cloud Support Policy. For clarity, if Worldpay has purchased any Cloud Services, Worldpay must also separately purchase Cloud Support for the term corresponding to the applicable Cloud Term for the purchased Cloud Services. 4.9 Audit of Worldpay's Use. Supplier may run reports on the applicable analytics platform from time to time to determine any overages by Worldpay. If there are overages, Supplier shall share the reports with Worldpay indicating the overages along with necessary invoices to charge for these overages. If Supplier does not have access to the applicable analytics platform to run the necessary usage reports, Supplier may request Worldpay to run the relevant reports and upon such request, Worldpay shall timely provide the usage reports to Supplier for invoicing purposes. 5. PROFESSIONAL SERVICES 5.1 Professional Services (a) Statements of Work. Any implementation and other professional services (\"Professional Services”) to be provided by Supplier to Worldpay with respect to the Cloud Services shall be purchased separately by Worldpay in an SOW agreed between the parties. Supplier will assign appropriately experienced personnel to perform the Professional Services and will use reasonable endeavors to minimize changes of personnel so assigned. Any timescales set forth in the SOW(s) are estimates only and Supplier will use all reasonable endeavors to achieve agreed timescales. Supplier may, at Supplier's expense and with Worldpay's prior written approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), use subcontractors to perform the Professional Services. (b) Defects Caused by Third Parties. If Worldpay elects to have any implementation or other professional services for the Cloud Services provided by a third party, Supplier shall have no liability for any defect or failure of the Cloud Service caused by such third-party services, and Worldpay shall not be entitled to any reduction in fees for the Cloud Services as a result thereof. Supplier may deny access to the Cloud Services to any third-party service provider which Supplier determines in its reasonable discretion poses a security or confidentiality risk to Supplier systems, data or intellectual property. (c) Delays; Rescheduling. Except where the relevant SOW provides otherwise, scheduling of Supplier's resources must be agreed to no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the date work is scheduled to begin. (d) Acceptance. Professional Services and\/or Deliverables will be subject to Acceptance Criteria. Where applicable and required in the applicable SOW, the Supplier shall provide Worldpay with all Acceptance test results and permit Worldpay to be present during such testing. Once Acceptance Criteria are met to Worldpay's reasonable satisfaction or otherwise decides to accept the Professional Services, Worldpay shall inform the Supplier of the same in writing (\"Acceptance”). Worldpay will endeavor to notify Supplier on or before any acceptance date set forth in the applicable SOW or if not specified in the applicable SOW, then within ten (10) business days from receipt of the Professional Services or Deliverables from Supplier (\"Acceptance Date”). Where all the relevant Deliverables and\/or Professional Services for a Milestone are con-12255 9 DocuSign Envelope ID: A7DB720C-2208-4C7F-9FF7-1CCEBC228DB3 Accepted, the Supplier shall have achieved the relevant Milestone for such Deliverables and\/or Professional Services as specified in the SOW. If Worldpay notifies Supplier that the relevant Professional Services or any portion thereof fail to pass Acceptance Testing, Supplier will use its commercially reasonable efforts to promptly correct all such material deficiencies. Within ten (10) business days (or such other period as specified in the applicable Statement of Work) after such corrections have been made, Worldpay will retest the relevant Professional Services or Deliverables. If the Professional Services or Deliverables still fail Acceptance Testing, Worldpay may, in its sole discretion: (i) grant Supplier additional time to correct the outstanding material deficiencies; or (ii) terminate the relevant Statement of Work for such deficient Professional Services or Deliverables. If Worldpay does not issue written confirmation of Acceptance or non-Acceptance by the applicable Acceptance Date, then the Professional Services and Deliverables will be deemed to be irrevocably Accepted. Cloud Services Offerings, Managed Services and Custom Support are not subject to any Acceptance requirements. (e) Excusable Delay. Supplier shall not be liable for any delay or failure in performance due to (i) any documented instructions of Worldpay or inaccurate information provided by Worldpay, (iii) breach by Worldpay of any of its obligations hereunder, or (ii) the inaccuracy of any assumption stated in any SOW. (f) The Supplier shall comply promptly with the lawful requests of Worldpay related to this Agreement, shall keep Worldpay regularly informed of progress in relation to an SOW and shall attend meetings and discussions whenever reasonably requested by Worldpay. 5.2 Additional Professional Services Requirements (a) Professional Services Expenses. Unless agreed otherwise in the applicable Order Form or SOW for the Professional Services, Worldpay shall reimburse Supplier all approved in writing in advance reasonable travel related expenses incurred, in accordance with Worldpay travel policies by Supplier in performing such Professional Services. Unless agreed otherwise in writing with the Worldpay, such expenses will be reimbursed by Worldpay in accordance with Worldpay travel and expenses policy as set forth in Schedule 9 attached hereto. (b) Worldpay's Responsibilities. Worldpay will provide to Supplier, promptly on request, such information and facilities as Supplier reasonably requires for the provision of the Professional Services and Custom Support. Worldpay shall be responsible for procuring all consents, licenses, approvals or permissions for products or services provided by Worldpay as may be necessary to enable Supplier to perform the Professional Services and Custom Support. Worldpay acknowledges and agrees that Supplier's performance is dependent on and subject to performance by Worldpay or third parties of their obligations associated with the Professional Services and Custom Support in a timely manner and is subject to any assumptions regarding the Professional Services and Custom Support referred to in the Custom Support Policy or SOW, as applicable. Supplier reserves the right to charge for any work carried out by Supplier or delay caused to Supplier which is attributable to Worldpay's failure to observe its dependencies as documented in the SOW and as amended through Change Control (as defined below). (c) Change Control. Worldpay may at any time request, and Supplier may at any time, recommend reasonable changes to the Professional Services. Neither party will be obliged to agree to any requested or recommended change but neither party will unreasonably withhold, delay or condition its agreement where the change would be materially consistent with the subject matter and scope of the existing Services and Agreement. Supplier will advise Worldpay of the likely impact of any requested or recommended change on the price and timescales for the Services. Until such time as any change is agreed in writing by the authorized representatives of both parties, Supplier will continue to perform and con-12255 10 DocuSign Envelope ID: A7DB720C-2208-4C7F-9FF7-1CCEBC228DB3 to be paid for the Professional Services as if such change had not been requested or recommended. (d) The Supplier shall, except as otherwise expressly provided in an SOW, be responsible at its own cost for providing the facilities, Personnel and any other resources required to provide the Professional Services. (e) Worldpay will provide such Worldpay Equipment and facilities to the Supplier as set out in the applicable SOW and the Supplier agrees in relation to the Worldpay Equipment: i. it has no legal or equitable claim to the Worldpay Equipment and will not to contest ownership of it; ii. it shall not purport to pledge or in any way charge by way of security any Worldpay Equipment which shall at all times remain Worldpay's and\/or, if applicable, a third party lessor's property and shall waive any rights that may arise to take a lien over the Worldpay Equipment for any sums due to the Supplier pursuant to this Agreement and\/or any SOW; iii. it shall only use the it for the provision of the Services and, where the Worldpay Equipment consists of third party software, shall comply with the terms of such licenses where these have been brought to its attention by Worldpay or the third party licensor; iv. it shall be liable to Worldpay for any reasonable expenses, damages, claims and costs, including reasonable costs of repair, replacement and restoration arising out of or in connection with any damage (excluding fair wear and tear) or destruction to the Worldpay Equipment or facilities to the extent caused by the Supplier; and v. on termination of this Agreement and\/or the applicable SOW, it shall return the Worldpay Equipment to Worldpay. 6. CONTRACT MANAGEMENT 6.1 Each Party will appoint a person responsible for the overall relationship with the other Party (\"Representative\"). The Supplier's Representative cannot be changed without Worldpay's prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) and no such consent is required as a result of Supplier's Representative's unavailability due to termination of employment, death or disability. 6.2 Unless a person is named as Key Personnel, the Supplier may replace its Personnel at any time by written notice to Worldpay. Worldpay may replace its Personnel at any time by written notice to the Supplier. 6.3 The Representatives will communicate with each other throughout the Term as reasonably necessary for the performance of the Agreement. 6.4 If Worldpay (acting reasonably) determines that a member of the Personnel should be removed from the provision of the Professional Services, Worldpay will notify the Supplier in writing and the Supplier will immediately remove that person from the provision of the Professional Services and will not permit that person to be involved subsequently in the provision of the Professional Services without the prior written consent of Worldpay. 6.5 Without prejudice to its rights under this clause 6.5 Worldpay may deny any of the Personnel access to any Group Company premises, systems and\/or data if it reasonably believes that the person concerned is not trustworthy or is otherwise unsuitable and may insist that the Supplier removes such person and replaces them with someone who is suitable. 6.6 For Key Personnel, the Supplier shall provide such individuals for the duration of the term of the relevant SOW unless prevented from doing so by circumstances outside the reasonable control of the Supplier. 6.7 The Supplier shall comply with Schedule 3 (Pre-Employment Screening) in relation to any of the Personnel who provide the Services from or at any of Worldpay's offices or other facilities or who have access to Worldpay systems. If any such Personnel do not meet Worldpay's background check requirements, Supplier shall not assign such employee or con-12255 11 DocuSign Envelope ID: A7DB720C-2208-4C7F-9FF7-1CCEBC228DB3 candidate to the Worldpay account or allow such employee or candidate access to Worldpay's Confidential Information or be used in the provision of the Services. 6.8 Failure by the Supplier to comply with the provisions of clauses 7.5 to 7.7 inclusive will be a material breach of this Agreement by the Supplier. 7. CHARGES AND PAYMENT 7.1 In consideration for the performance of the Services, Worldpay shall pay to the Supplier the Charges as set out in the applicable Order Form or SOW; such Charges shall be exclusive of tax or equivalent which (where applicable) shall be charged in addition, except for taxes exclusively attributable to the Supplier's income. 7.2 the following invoicing terms shall apply: (a) Cloud Services and Cloud Support Fees. Unless agreed otherwise in the applicable Order Form, Supplier will invoice fees for Cloud Services and Cloud Support for the entire Initial Cloud Term in advance, on the applicable Commencement Date. Unless agreed otherwise in the applicable Order Form, fees for Cloud Services and Cloud Support for each Renewal Cloud Term will be invoiced entirely in advance prior to the start of such Renewal Cloud Term. All fees for Cloud Services are based on Cloud Services subscriptions purchased and not actual usage, and quantities purchased cannot be decreased during the relevant Cloud Term. Once placed, Worldpay's order for Cloud Services, Cloud Services Add-Ons and Cloud Support is non-cancelable and the sums paid nonrefundable, except as provided in this Agreement. Worldpay agrees that Worldpay purchase of subscription(s) for the Cloud Services is neither contingent upon the delivery of any future functionality or features nor dependent upon any oral or written public comments made by Supplier, including any roadmaps, with respect to future functionality or features. (b) Cloud Services Add-Ons Fees. Unless agreed otherwise in the applicable Order Form for the Cloud Services Add-Ons, Supplier will invoice Fees for the Cloud Services Add¬ Ons for each term of the Cloud Services Add-On in advance of such term. With respect to the On-Demand Security Scan Add-On and the Supplier On-Site Audit Add-On however, Worldpay's rights to use such purchased On-Demand Security Scan Add-On and\/or the Supplier On-Site Audit Add-On commences on the date of purchase of such Cloud Add-Ons, subject to the thirty (30) day advance notice requirement and is for one-time use only by Worldpay. Supplier will invoice Worldpay upfront for the minimum number of required usage hours specified for such On-Demand Security Scan Add-On and the Supplier On-Site Audit Add-On, provided that if Worldpay utilizes more than the minimum number of required usage hours specified for such Cloud Add-Ons, Supplier will invoice Worldpay in arrears on a time and materials basis for any additional hours utilized by Worldpay for the security scan or on-site security audit. There is no refund to Worldpay of any amounts paid by Worldpay even if Worldpay utilizes less than the minimum number of required usage hours specified for such Cloud Services Add-On. (c) Professional Services Fees. Where the Professional Services are to be paid for on a time and materials basis, the Supplier shall invoice Worldpay the Charges monthly in arrears unless detailed otherwise in an SOW. Where Milestones apply to the Profesional Services, the Supplier may invoice Worldpay its Charges for the Professional Services once a Milestone has been achieved unless agreed otherwise in the applicable SOW. 7.3 Each invoice shall quote this Agreement, Worldpay's purchase order number, the date and\/or number of the relevant SOW, and contain such other information as Worldpay may reasonably require from time to time. Invoices shall be sent directly to Worldpay Accounts Payable by e-mail to accountspayable@vantiv.com. Worldpay shall pay the Charges within forty-five (45) days of receipt of a valid invoice. All Charges shall be calculated and payments made in U.S. Dollars unless otherwise set out in an SOW. 7.4 Notwithstanding clause 7.3 above, Worldpay may reasonably withhold payment of Charges it disputes in good faith. In such circumstances it will inform the Supplier of the basis of the dispute and pay any undisputed portion of the Charges. The Parties shall use all reasonable efforts to resolve any such dispute as quickly as possible in accordance with con-12255 12 DocuSign Envelope ID: A7DB720C-2208-4C7F-9FF7-1CCEBC228DB3 clause 22. Supplier may suspend its performance under this Agreement, in whole or in part, on 10 days written notice without liability to Worldpay if Worldpay has failed to pay in full any undisputed amounts contained in an invoice from the Supplier within thirty (30) days of the due date of payment of such invoice or otherwise materially breaches this Agreement. Supplier will resume performance as soon as commercially practicable upon Worldplay's cure of the breach (if such breach is capable of cure). 7.6 The Supplier shall maintain Records in respect of all expenditure that is reimbursable by Worldpay under this Agreement, along with any Charges that are payable on a time and materials basis, and provide copies of the same to Worldpay at Worldpay's written request. Worldpay shall reimburse to the Supplier against receipts, all reasonable and properly incurred travelling and accommodation expenses to the extent agreed in an SOW and subject at all times to the Worldpay travel and expenses policy, a copy which shall be attached as Schedule 9 attached hereto. 7.7 The Supplier shall be solely responsible for all tax liabilities arising under this Agreement in respect of the Personnel and shall account to the appropriate authorities for all tax and national insurance or similar contributions payable in respect of the supply of Services (collectively, \"Personnel Tax Payments”). The Supplier shall indemnify Worldpay, its Group Companies, officers and\/or directors against all Losses suffered or incurred by Worldpay, its Group Companies, officers and\/or directors to the extent arising out of or in connection with any third party claims brought against the indemnified parties to the exent caused by Supplier's failure to make such Personnel Tax payments. 7.8 The Supplier acknowledges that time is of the essence in the submission of any invoices to Worldpay in order to avoid reconciliation problems associated with outdated invoices. Worldpay's obligation to pay any undisputed invoice shall be subject to the Supplier's submission to Worldpay of such invoice in a timely fashion, in accordance with the applicable SOW, but in no event later than ninety (90) days after the date the applicable Services and\/or Deliverables were completed and delivered. 7.9 If the Order Form sets forth a specific dollar amount to be paid for any Services purchased on a subscription or time based (each a \"Subscription Based Services”), the unit price for the purchased Subscription Based Services will not increase annually during any Renewal Cloud Term by more than the lesser of (a) CPI or (b)three percent (3%), as compared to the prior year. CPI” means the total percentage increase (if any) in the United States Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) as published by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (or, in the event that the CPI is no longer published, such other comparable measure of inflation as may be widely recognized and mutually agreed upon by the parties) for the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year in which the increase applies.

Worldpay's failure to comply with the obligations of this clause will constitute unauthorized use of the terminated Services, entitling Supplier to equitable relief as provided in this Agreement and other legal and equitable remedies. Within thirty (30) days of any termination of this Agreement or any Order Form or SOW, Worldpay shall pay to Supplier all unpaid fees accrued prior to such termination. 15.7 The parties expressly agree that this Agreement is being entered into while Worldpay completes its security reviews.

Upon exercising such Special Termination Right, Worldpay shall pay Supplier for the Professional Service hours provided to Worldpay at the rates provided for on the SOW for such Professional Services up until the effective date of termination. For clarity, eGain must have received the written notice from Worldpay of its election to exercise the Special termination Right by the Termination Deadline. Worldpay shall not be entitled to exercise this Special Termination Right at any time after the Termination Deadline and if Worldpay has not exercised such Special Termination Right by the Termination Deadline, this Agreement, the Order Forms and SOWs executed by Worldpay (including, without limitation, Worldpay's obligation to pay for the Cloud Services Offerings and Professional Services purchased under such Order Forms and SOWs) shall remain in effect. 16 INDEMNIFICATION AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY 16.1 Indemnification 16.1.1 Supplier Indemnification.

Indemnified Party shall promptly notify Indemnifying Party in writing of any allegation, claim, arbitration, investigation, lawsuit o r action provided for in this Agreement (each a \"General Indemnification Claim”) provided however that a party's failure to provide or delay in providing such notice shall not relieve a party of its obligations under this clause 16.1 except to the extent such failure or delay prejudices the defense; (b) the party who is obligated hereunder to defend a claim having the right to fully control the defense of such claim, provided that no defense or settlement imposes any harm, blame or financial cost on the Indemnified Party; and (c) the party against whom a third party claim is brought reasonably cooperating in the defense of such claim at the Indenmnifying Party's expense. Any settlement of any claim shall not include a financial or specific performance obligation on or admission of liability by the party against whom the claim is brought, provided however that Supplier may settle any claim on a basis requiring Supplier to substitute for the Supplier Service or offering any alternate substantially equivalent non-infringing product or service. Indemnified Party shall retain the exclusive right to select its counsel in defending, and conduct the defense of, any General Indemnification Claim. Indemnifying Party may not, without Indemnified Party's prior written consent, settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any General Indemnification Claim. 16.2 Nothing in this Agreement shall operate so as to exclude or limit the liability of either Party to the other for: (a) Death or personal injury arising out of negligence, fraud; (b) grossly negligent acts or omissions; (c) any liability arising in connection with the Parties' indemnification obligations, or breach of confidentiality under clause 11; (d) Supplier's right to collect unpaid fees due hereunder; (e) liabilities arising from Worldpay's or its Users' infringement of Supplier's Intellectual Property; or (f) any other liability which cannot be excluded or limited by law. 16.3 THE PARTIES AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING LIABILITY CAPS: (A) SUBJECT TO CLAUSE 16.2 ABOVE, THE TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF EITHER PARTY UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT INCLUDING LIABILITY FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT, MISREPRESENTATION (WHETHER TORTIOUS OR STATUTORY), TORT (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, NEGLIGENCE), BREACH OF STATUTORY DUTY OR OTHERWISE, SHALL NOT EXCEED THE FEES PAID BY WORLDPAY TO SUPPLIER FOR con-12255 24 DocuSign Envelope ID: A7DB720C-2208-4C7F-9FF7-1CCEBC228DB3 THE AFFECTED SERVICES DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE FIRST INCIDENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM(S) OR ACTION(S).

In consideration of the payments to be made and services to be performed hereunder, the parties agree as follows: TERMS AND CONDITIONS 1. DEFINITIONS 1.1. References. In this Agreement, references and mention of the word \"includes\" and \"including\" shall mean \"includes, without limitation\" and \"including, without limitation,\" as applicable. 1.2. Interpretation. In the event of a conflict between the general terms and conditions and the terms of any exhibits and schedules attached hereto, the terms of the schedules and exhibits shall prevail and control the interpretation of the Agreement. The exhibits and schedules together with the general terms and conditions shall be interpreted as a single document. 2. BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP 2.1. Services. Provider shall supply the services described in Schedule A to this Agreement (the “Services”). Provider grants to FIS the exclusive, worldwide right and license, solely as set forth in Section 2.5 below (in all other cases, the grant is non-exclusive), (“Software License”) to use an object code (executable) version of the Provider's EMX Enterprise software (“Licensed Software”) solely to rebrand and resell the Services under its own private label to business and commercial entities, including, but not limited to, financial institutions (collectively, “FIS Customers”) in the form of separate and distinct (i) Software as a Service agreements (“SaaS Agreements”) with certain FIS Customers by and through which such FIS Customer may access and use the Service (such FIS Customers, the “SaaS Customers”) or (ii) sublicense agreements (“License Agreements”) with certain FIS Customers by and through which such FIS Customer is licensed a copy of the Licensed Software (such FIS Customers, the “License Customers”). This license will permit FIS to provide the Services to process FIS Customers' Data and support the Services. Provider also grants FIS a non-exclusive, worldwide right to use, reproduce and distribute to FIS Customers Provider's documentation that describes the proper procedures for using the Licensed Software and provides sufficient information to enable FIS to operate and maintain the Licensed Software (“Licensed Documentation”). 2.2. FIS acknowledges and agrees that: A. if FIS substantively modifies the Licensed Documentation, Provider is not responsible for, and Provider's warranty of the Licensed Documentation does not extend to, such modifications. B. FIS' reverse engineering or modification in any way of the Licensed Software is a material breach under the Agreement. C. Provider's logo and statement “Powered by Eco-Mail,” will at all times remain clearly visible, on the bottom each screen, regardless of the branding by FIS. 1 D. The license granted in this Section 2.2 does not grant FIS the right to use the Licensed Software for FIS' own purposes (except to perform its rights and obligations under this Agreement); such use will require FIS to execute a separate SaaS Agreement or Enterprise License, as applicable, with Provider. E. If FIS enters into License Agreements with License Customers, Provider will, on behalf of FIS, and as a condition to FIS entering into such License Agreements, provide support and maintenance to the License Customers pursuant to the Software Maintenance terms attached hereto as Schedule B. F. If FIS enters into SaaS Agreements with SaaS Customers, Provider will provide support and maintenance to FIS pursuant to the Software Maintenance terms attached hereto as Schedule B. G. If FIS or any FIS Customer needs support and maintenance other than as described in Schedule B, Provider will bill FIS for such support and maintenance at Provider's professional services rates as specified in Schedule A. 2.3 Provided the SaaS Agreement and\/or Sales Order and\/or License Agreement with each FIS Customer is in compliance with this Agreement, including, but not limited to, Schedule A, and Schedule B, FIS shall not be required to submit such SaaS Agreement and\/or each Sales Order and\/or License Agreement to Provider for its prior review. If, however, any term of the SaaS Agreement and\/or Sales Order and\/or License Agreement with an FIS Customer deviates in any material manner from the terms of this Agreement, FIS will obtain Provider's prior written approval to each such material deviation. 2.4 Implementation. The Services shall be implemented and made available by Provider for FIS's use on such implementation date and for such fees as is set forth in the applicable Schedule or mutually agreed by the parties. Any and all conditions on FIS's access to or use of the Services shall be set forth in Schedule A hereto. 2.5 Exclusive Channel. Provider agrees that, provided FIS complies with this Section 2.5, FIS shall be the exclusive reseller distribution channel for up to three years, for providing the Services under a SaaS Agreement as an Application Service Provider (\"ASP\") in a hosted environment under a SaaS Agreement solely to financial institutions with a primary Standard Industrial Classification code beginning with 60 (Depository Institutions), 61 (Nondepository credit institutions), and 62 (Security and Commodity Brokers, Dealers, Exchanges, and Services) (collectively \"Financial Institutions\"). The exclusivity granted by this Section 2.5 will begin upon the Effective Date and will continue until December 31, 2020 (\"First Exclusivity Period\"). The exclusivity will automatically be renewed for a period of one year (until December 31, 2021) (\"Second Exclusivity Period\") if FIS executes contracts resulting in payments by FIS to Provider hereunder of fees of at least $1,000,000 during the First Exclusivity Period. On December 31, 2021, this exclusivity will automatically be renewed for a period of one more year (until December 31, 2022) (\"Final Exclusivity Period\") if, FIS executes contracts resulting in payments by FIS to Provider hereunder of fees of at least $3,000,000 during the Second Exclusivity Period. In the event that FIS does not meet the annual automatic renewal targets for either the First Exclusivity Period or the Second Exclusivity Period, the exclusivity provided under this Section 2.5 shall cease on the last day of the applicable exclusivity period for which the target was not achieved unless the Provider, in its sole discretion, determines to continue exclusivity for an additional number of months, to be determined by Provider. Unless otherwise terminated earlier, as provided in the preceding sentences, the exclusivity provided in this Section 2.5 will automatically terminate on the last day of the Final Exclusivity Period. For the avoidance of doubt (i) the exclusivity provided in this Section 2.5 is solely granted to FIS in its capacity as an ASP or hosting service provider and shall not apply to the Provider's or any other party's sale or 2 resale of the Services to customers as licensed software and (ii) FIS may also resell the Services without serving as an ASP, but FIS has no exclusivity for such sales. A. Furthermore, this Section 2.5 shall not apply to the following situations: 1. Providers of outsourced mailroom services which include the provision or management of physical mail delivery where such party already has an existing contract for physical mail sorting and delivery may resell the Services either in a hosted or licensed capacity to their existing customer base 2. Provider may participate as a provider of software to any participant in a formal RFP competitive process initiated by any company, including Financial Institutions as described in this provision. Participants in open RFP processes, may host the Provider's software as a component of their proposal. FIS acknowledges and agrees that the exclusivity granted to FIS under this Agreement is limited to specific financial institutions and solely for the stated time period, all as set forth in Section 2.5 above. Provider is, at all times, free to enter into agreements with other companies or individuals for the resale or licensing of its Services except as prohibited hereunder. 2.6 Non-solicitation. FIS shall own the relationship with all FIS Customers.. Within five (5) business days of the end of each calendar month, FIS shall deliver to Provider a list of FIS Customers and prospective customers with whom FIS has engaged during such calendar month regarding the Services (each, a \"Prospective FIS Customer”), and, with respect to Prospective FIS Customers, the first date and method by which the Prospective FIS Customer was contacted and the status of such discussions. In addition, the parties will hold a monthly call to discuss the content of such list. Provided Provider has reasonable advance written notice of an FIS Customer or FIS' ongoing or active resale effort to a Prospective FIS Customer, during the term of this Agreement, Provider shall not, without the express written consent of FIS, directly or through any other reseller, solicit any FIS Customers or Prospective FIS Customers or their respective customers for any products or services unless the underlying SaaS Agreement between FIS and the FIS Customer is terminated, in which case FIS agrees that Provider may approach such FIS Customer to provide the Services directly. Further, upon termination of this Agreement for FIS's breach, Provider may approach any FIS Customer or Prospective FIS Customer to provide the Services directly. Nothing in this Section 2.4. shall limit Provider's right, at any time, to provide Services directly or through a reseller to an FIS Customer or potential FIS Customer provided Provider or such reseller has independently engaged with such FIS Customer or potential FIS Customer. In addition Provider shall not contact a Prospective FIS Customer for a period of ninety (90) days following the cessation of a sales effort with such Prospective FIS Customer, absent FIS' prior written consent. 2.7 Additional Responsibilities of Provider. Provider agrees to be responsible for performing those additional obligations set forth in Schedule A hereto. 2.8 Additional Responsibilities of FIS. FIS agrees to be responsible for performing those additional obligations set forth in Schedule A hereto. 2.9 Third Party Use of Licensed Software. FIS shall be permitted to grant FIS Customers' agents, disaster recovery services providers, hosting services providers and other third parties providing processing, business or technical services or advice to a FIS Customer to use the Licensed Software, provided each such party must agree in writing: (a) to use the Licensed Software and Licensed Documentation subject to the terms of this Agreement and (b) to be bound by confidentiality obligations no less restrictive than those in this Agreement. 2.10 Non-Productive Use and Copies of Licensed Software. FIS may make copies of and use the Licensed Software for testing, development, quality assurance, backup, archival, emergency restart, disaster recovery and similar purposes and may, at its option, store those copies off-site. None of those copies will be included when 3 counting the number of copies or the amount of use under any per-copy, per-transaction, per-location or other similar pricing scheme. To the extent FIS is reproducing copies of the Licensed Software, FIS will reproduce any copyright notices or other proprietary notices in the Licensed Software. 2.11 Operating Environments. “Operating Environment” means the hardware platform and any other equipment, configurations, operating systems, control programs, software and other elements of the operating environment (including an Internet or Internet oriented operating environment or a virtual or cloud environment) on or in which FIS uses the Licensed Software. Provider acknowledges that FIS may want or need to run the Licensed Software on multiple, different, successor or replacement Operating Environments or components thereof. Consequently, the Software License will be deemed to include all versions of the Licensed Software that are capable of supporting various Operating Environments or components thereof; provided, however, no Operating Environments will be outside the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, or the European Union. Upon FIS's request, and at no additional charge, Provider will promptly deliver to FIS the versions of the Licensed Software together with copies of the Licensed Documentation, as may be required to use in such other Operating Environments. 2.12 Successor Products of Licensed Software. If Provider removes any features or functionality from the Licensed Software and subsequently offers those features or functionality in a new or different product (whether directly or indirectly or through a third party), then the Software License will be deemed to include: (a) the portion of those new or different products that contain the original features, or (b) if those features cannot be separated out, the entire product. If Provider stops licensing the Licensed Software other than as bundled or otherwise combined with other software, the Software License will be deemed to include that other software. If the Licensed Software is a suite or other combination of software products, and Provider elects to unbundle or otherwise separately license those products, the Software License will be deemed to include all of the products containing the functionality originally licensed to FIS. There will be no additional charge for changes to the scope of the Software License under this Section 2.12; provided, however, this Section 2.12 will not apply to Optional Updates, as defined in Section 10 of Schedule B below. 2.13 Use of Licensed Software in an Alternative Processing Complex. The Software License will include the right to use the Licensed Software in a virtual environment whether on a multiprocessor computer, a set of computers connected together to act as one computer, or another type of processing complex. Use on a processing complex will be deemed to be use on a single computer, regardless of the number of CPUs in the processing complex. Provider will not charge any upgrade fee or other additional charge for such use or if FIS: (a) moves the Licensed Software to a processing complex that has a greater capacity or belongs to what is commonly described as a higher tier group, or (b) adds processors or other additional capacity to any computer in the processing complex or (c) changes the technologies used in the virtual environment (e.g., from VMWare to MS HyperV). 2.14 Electronic Delivery of Licensed Software. Provider will deliver the Licensed Software and Licensed Documentation through purely electronic communication. 2.15 Authorization Codes for Licensed Software. Provider will provide any passwords, keys and other authorization codes that FIS needs to enable FIS Customers to use the Licensed Software. Further, those authorization codes will be fully functional on all Operating Environments. 2.16 Security Baseline Configuration. If the Licensed Software is security configurable, Provider will provide FIS with Security Baseline Configuration Settings at the time it delivers the Licensed Software to FIS and with updates to such settings promptly after Provider begins to distribute the updates generally. “Security Baseline Configuration Settings” means the software configuration settings recommended by Provider that affect the security of the Licensed Software. Provider will provide FIS with patches or fixes and a written description and rating of the risk that each patch or fix addresses and will do so promptly after Provider begins to distribute the patches or fixes generally. Provider will promptly notify FIS about any security related or other issues that affect the Licensed Software and will include in such notice a rating of risk associated with those issues and the 4 reasonably expected impact that the issues may have on any FIS Entity or their customers. Provider acknowledges that the Licensed Software and Services incorporate Open Source Software selected and included solely by Provider. Provider will retain all responsibility for such Open Source Software and will regularly scan for security vulnerabilities and provide security patches to fix identified security vulnerabilities. Provider will not use or include any Open Source Software in a manner that creates an obligation for FIS or a Customer to (1) license or distribute any proprietary FIS or Customer software or source code to another party, (2) grant any FIS or Customer intellectual property rights to another party, or (3) redistribute any FIS or Customer proprietary software or source code under the terms or conditions of any Open Source License. 2.17. Ownership Rights in Licensed Software and Data. As between Provider and FIS: (a) title to the Licensed Software and Licensed Documentation, and all intellectual property rights in the Licensed Software and Licensed Documentation, will at all times remain with Provider, subject to the Software License; 3. FEES 3.1. Fee Structure. FIS agrees to pay Provider the fees specified in Schedule A. Provider shall not have any right or authority to assess or collect any fees or charges from FIS Customers or their customers. 3.2. Disputed Amounts. If FIS disputes any charge or amount on any invoice and such dispute cannot be resolved promptly through good faith discussions between the parties, FIS shall pay the amounts due under this Agreement less the disputed amount, and the parties shall diligently proceed to resolve such disputed amount. (a) Terms of Payment. Within ten (10) business days of the end of each calendar month, FIS will provide Provider with a monthly report with sufficient detail to enable Provider to determine each FIS Customer's use of the Services. FIS' failure to provide such monthly reports will be a material breach of this Agreement, for which Provider shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement for cause, in accordance with Section 5.3, provided, however, the notice period in Section 5.3 shall be reduced for purposes of this Section 3.2(a) to ten (10) business days. Provider will invoice FIS on a monthly basis for the Services, based on such monthly reports. Except for amounts reasonably in dispute, fees invoiced under this Agreement shall be due and payable within forty-five (45) days after the receipt of such invoice, but in no event more than seventy-five (75) days after the last day of the month in which such fees are incurred. Provider may charge interest on the past due amount at the rate of 1% per month calculated daily and compounded monthly or, if lower, the highest rate permitted under applicable law. 3.3. Most Favored Pricing. Specifically as it relates to the provision of the Services as an ASP, under a SaaS Agreement, Provider agrees as follows: A. If, during the term of this Agreement, Provider enters into a contract permitting any third party to resell the Services or services substantially similar to the Services to Financial Institutions at wholesale unit pricing less than that charged to FIS under this Agreement, then Provider shall immediately adjust FIS's unit pricing to a level at or below the unit pricing provided to the third party. B. If, during the term of this Agreement, Provider enters into a contract to provide the Services or services substantially similar to the Services directly to any Financial Institution at retail unit pricing that is less than the wholesale unit pricing charged to FIS under this Agreement plus a markup computed using the retail price markup percentage shown for the respective service(s) in Schedule A hereto (the “Markup”), then Provider shall immediately adjust FIS's unit pricing to a level at or below the unit pricing offered to the third party, less the Markup. 3.4 Right to Audit Fees and Charges. Provider shall deliver to FIS for installation, and FIS agrees to install, a custom reporting software that will track the usage of Provider's product by each FIS Customers for calculating fees payable to Provider hereunder. In addition, FIS shall keep and maintain full, accurate and detailed records regarding fees charged to FIS Customers under this Agreement and FIS' compliance with its obligations hereunder. Provider or its representatives shall be entitled to review and audit FIS records from time to time, but 5 no more frequently than once annually, unless the audit yields negative results, in which case Provider will be able to audit twice annually, for purposes of determining compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Any such audits shall be performed during normal FIS business hours by providing written notice to FIS at least thirty (30) days prior to such audit. If any such audit reveals an understatement of gross sales by FIS to Provider hereunder, FIS shall immediately pay Provider the amount of fees due on such understatement. If the fees payable to Provider as a result of such understatement are greater than five percent (5%) of the fees actually paid for such audited period, FIS shall pay the reasonable expenses associated with such audit, in addition to the corrected fees. 4.

When available, a solution or workaround will be applied via Internet, provided that the issue is caused by an Error, and not as a result of circumstances beyond Provider's responsibility or control. The goal is to either resolve or provide a work around for Priority Level 2 Support Incidents within twenty four (24) hours. The permanent resolution will be provided with the future software updates. Priority Level 3: A Support Incident is classified as Priority Level 3 when the Error or defect causes the impairment of a major feature of Licensed Software without entirely preventing its use. A Priority Level 3 Support Incident will be treated with medium urgency. Provider will acknowledge the incident within eight (8) hours and contact FIS as needed with status reports. Provided that the issue is caused by an Error and not as a result of circumstances beyond Provider's control, the goal is to either resolve or provide a work around for Priority Level 3 Support Incidents within seven (7) business days. The permanent resolution will be provided with the future software updates. Priority Level 4: A Support Incident that falls outside the classifications described above are considered Priority Level 4 support issues. Provided that the issue is caused by an Error, and not as a result of circumstances beyond Provider's control and will be treated as low urgency. Provider will acknowledge the incident within 24 hours. The goal is to resolve Priority Level 4 support issues through scheduled support updates or generally released Software Updates. “Support Incident” is a request for assistance resolving an unplanned interruption to, or a reduction in the quality of, the availability of the Licensed Software. 18 SCHEDULE B SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE TERMS 1. General Software Maintenance Terms. The terms of this Schedule B apply to the Provider's maintenance obligations to FIS in the support of the SaaS Services and when FIS licenses the Licensed Software to a License Customer, in which case License Customer will be required to enter into a software license and maintenance agreement with FIS pursuant to which FIS (through Provider) will provide the following maintenance and support Services (\"Software Maintenance”) for the Licensed Software (for the avoidance of doubt, these terms will not apply to a SaaS Customer): (a) preventive and remedial services to maintain the Licensed Software in good operating condition; (b) corrections, enhancements, improvements, releases, versions and other updates (other than Optional Updates as defined in Section 10 below) for the Licensed Software (\"Updates”); (c) a telephone support line (direct to the License Customer) for use within the United States, and, if applicable, a telephone support line which can be accessed internationally; (d) online access to technical support bulletins; 2. Additional Responsibilities. (a) Provider. The Provider personnel assigned to perform Software Maintenance will be fully qualified to do so and familiar with both the applicable Licensed Software and FIS' and License Customer's use of that Licensed Software. (b) FIS. The following terms are applicable to FIS or a Licensed Customer, as applicable (for the purposes of this section \"FIS” is referenced): (i) When FIS requests maintenance and support, FIS will provide Provider's maintenance and support personnel with access to FIS personnel that are knowledgeable about IT support issues generally or the Licensed Software specifically (ii) If the problem that FIS is experiencing cannot be reasonably duplicated at Provider's support facilities, to receive maintenance and support, FIS will provide Provider access to the equipment experiencing the problem. In such an event, if FIS does not provide Provider with such access, Provider's sole remedy is to deny FIS support and maintenance for the issue within the scope of this Section 2(b)(ii). For clarity, in such instances, Provider's refusal to provide support and maintenance is not a breach of the Agreement. (iii) In some instances, Provider cannot know that FIS is experiencing Errors unless FIS informs the Provider. In such instances, to receive support and maintenance services for such Errors, FIS must report the Errors to Provider in through the Provider Support Portal (as defined below) to receive maintenance and support for the same. In such an event, Provider will not know that there are Errors and is not obligated to provide maintenance or support for such Errors. (iv) FIS will retain back up copies of the Licensed Software. Provider will not store data that FIS processes using the Licensed Software. As a result, if FIS does not retain such data, Provider is unable to provide (and is not obligated to provide) Software Maintenance that requires re-loading of lost or corrupted data. . 19 (v) In some instances, FIS will need to provide timely transmission, release, or access to critical information as defined or requested by Provider to analyze and remediate Errors reported by FIS. In such instances, FIS must provide the same to receive maintenance and support services for the issue(s). (vi) FIS will notify Provider, in advance, of any significant changes made to FIS' IT environment that could reasonably be expected to adversely impact Provider's ability to perform Software Maintenance Services. (vii) Additional Support. FIS will train (or have Provider train) its personnel in the use and application of the Licensed Software. (c) If FIS requires Provider to come onsite for maintenance and support services beyond the scope of the maintenance\/support program, the parties will negotiate a Schedule for such services in good faith. For the avoidance of doubt, expenses will be reimbursed in accordance with the Agreement. 3. Support for Software Maintenance. Provider will provide FIS\/Licensed Customer with unlimited telephone support to the Designated Contact Persons (described in Section 4 below) to resolve questions about the implementation, configuration, use and operation of the Licensed Software, as well as the status of problems reported by FIS for issues covered by the scope of the support and maintenance program. The scope of the maintenance and support program is described in the Agreement and\/or applicable Schedule. Telephone support and Internet support will be available 24 hours per day, seven days per week, except as specified otherwise in the applicable Schedule. Provider will respond to FIS and resolve problems in accordance with the service levels set forth in the applicable Schedule. If the Schedule does not specify service levels or timeframes for performance, Provider will respond to and resolve Software Service Calls (as defined below) and perform its other obligations in a timely manner. 4. Service Calls; Tracking for Software Maintenance. FIS may place requests for Software Maintenance (\"Software Service Calls”) by entering a request in Provider's support portal (\"Support Portal”). Software Service Calls may be made only by the FIS Relationship Manager who may in turn designate no more than 10 individuals who will be authorized to contact Provider (each, a \"Designated Contact Person”). The Relationship Manager will provide Provider a written list (email is sufficient) of the Designated Contact Persons, which may be revised by the Relationship Manager from time to time. The Designated Contact Persons will use reasonable efforts to provide all information that Provider reasonably requests about each Software Service Call. Provider will maintain a record of all Software Service Calls and Provider's efforts to resolve problems. Provider will provide the Designated Contact Persons with a unique ticket number for each Software Service Call. In the event of concurrent Software Service Calls, FIS reserves the right to set the priority for the resolution of the problems. 5. Remedial Software Maintenance. Provider will promptly notify FIS of any Errors or other nonconformities in the Licensed Software. \"Error” means any error, defect or malfunction in the Licensed Software that: (a) causes the integrity of the Licensed Software's data to be compromised or corrupted; (b) causes an unexpected error message or fatal error to occur while using the Licensed Software; (c) causes the Licensed Software to fail to conform to any of the applicable warranties; or (d) otherwise causes the Licensed Software to fail . Provider will correct all Errors, repair or replace all defective or inoperable Licensed Software and otherwise cause the Licensed Software to be functioning in accordance with the service levels set forth in the applicable Schedule. 20 6. Updates to Licensed Software. Each Update will be provided as it is made generally available by Provider to any of its customers. Updates for Licensed Software will be deemed part of the Licensed Software. 7. Compatibility; Prior Version Support for Licensed Software. Provider represents and warrants that each Update will be compatible with each preceding version of the Licensed Software, including versions customized for FIS or Licensed Customers. Provider will continue to provide Software Maintenance for: (a) each Update for at least 48 months after delivery to FIS, and (b) at least the two immediately prior major Updates provided to FIS. The term “major Update” (also sometimes referred to as “version”) means an Update containing substantially enhanced business functionality not previously included in the Licensed Software. 8. Software Platforms. Provider will continue to maintain the Licensed Software in a form compatible with the most current equivalent forms and at least the two immediately prior versions of the operating systems, database systems, hardware and other third party platforms that FIS or Licensed Customers are using with the Licensed Software. Within a commercially reasonable time after a new version of any of those third party platforms becomes generally available, Provider will issue an Update to ensure that the Licensed Software remains compatible with that platform. If FIS or a Recipient elects to use another platform supported by Provider, then upon FIS' written request, which will include specific detail about the alternate platform configuration and specifications, Provider will deliver to FIS, copies of any generally available versions of the Licensed Software certified for use with the alternate platform at no additional charge (except additional license charges if specifically stated in the applicable Schedule). 9. Remote Access to Provide Software Maintenance. Except as expressly specified in the applicable Schedule, in no event will FIS or a Licensed Customer be required to provide Provider with any remote access to any FIS computer or network. In any event, Provider will not access any FIS computer or network unless this Agreement includes System Access Terms. 10. Fees for Software Maintenance Updates. There will be no charge for Updates (other than Optional Updates). Provider may charge for those Optional Updates requested and Accepted by FIS. Fees for Optional Updates will be as set forth in the applicable Schedule or Provider's prevailing license fees (less applicable FIS discounts) (whichever fees are lowest). The term “Optional Update” means an Update that: (a) is not required to cause the Software to be in Compliance or otherwise meet the requirements of this Agreement or applicable Law, (b) Provider licenses separately from each component of the Licensed Software for all of its customers, (c) Provider does not provide to any other customer without additional charge under any maintenance arrangement, and (d) provides substantially enhanced business (not merely technical) functionality. Functionality that supports new operating systems, database platforms or other third party technology will be considered technical functionality, rather than enhanced business functionality, and will be provided at no additional charge. 11. EXCEPTIONS Unless otherwise set forth in the applicable Schedule, the following services are excluded from Software Maintenance, which services are subject to availability of resources and, upon execution of the applicable professional services Schedule, will be charged for separately at the applicable professional services rates: (a) Software Maintenance does not cover Errors solely caused by: (i) unusual physical, electrical or electromagnetic stress; (ii) failure or fluctuation of electric power, air conditioning or humidity control; (iii) failure of rotation media not furnished by Provider; and (iv) excessive heating; fire and smoke damage. 21 (b) Software Maintenance does not cover Errors solely caused by the operation of the Licensed Software with other media and hardware, software or telecommunication interfaces not meeting or not maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications..; For clarity this Section 11 does not relieve Provider of its obligation to provide Software Maintenance when: (a) FIS' failure to update said other media, hardware, software or telecommunication; or (b) Provider modifies the Licensed Software to comply with FIS' use of media, hardware, software, or telecommunication interfaces that are not maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications. (c) Software Maintenance does not cover Errors solely caused by FIS or its agents. (d) Provider is not obligated to provide Software Maintenance for Errors solely caused by FIS knowingly and materially deviating from the specified operating procedures in the Licensed Documentation. (e) Software Maintenance does not cover Errors solely caused by the modification, alteration or addition, or attempted modification, alteration or addition, of the Licensed Software undertaken by persons other than Provider. For clarity, configuring the Licensed Software is not a modification, alteration, or addition that removes Provider's obligation to provide Software Maintenance. (f) Software Maintenance applies to the Licensed Software (including modifications made by the Provider on behalf of FIS), but does not extend to software programs made by FIS or other parties, or customized programs made by other parties. (g) Problems related to a prioritization or reprioritization of tasks by FIS, where Provider has notified FIS in advance that such prioritization or reprioritization may affect the operation of the Licensed Software and where FIS approves the change regardless of this notification. (h) Software Maintenance does not cover errors or malfunctions for any development, test or training systems environments except to the extent that FIS or a Licensed Customer identifies a functional error in the Licensed Software's then current feature set. In such instances, FIS and Provider shall establish a mutually agreed remediation schedule. (i) For any delay in or failure of by Provider or FIS under the Agreement or any applicable Schedule if such delay or failure arises by any reasons beyond either party's reasonable control, including any act of God, any acts of the common enemy, the elements, earthquakes, floods, fires, epidemics, riots, failures or delay in transportation or communications or utilities, or any act or failure to act by the other party or such other party's officers, employees, agents or contractors; provided, however, that lack of funds shall not be deemed to be a reason beyond a party's reasonable control. 22 SCHEDULE C Microsoft SQL Server 23 ","contract_name":"CW3462633","file_name":"Eco-Mail Development_Master Reseller Agmt_0220.pdf"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-05-12T06:48:16.002306Z","updated_at":"2022-05-12T18:12:51.219286Z","project":8},{"id":62,"annotations":[{"id":31,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":153,"end":171,"text":" ELASTICSEARCH LTD","labels":["Metadata Fields - Parties - Counterparty Name"]},"id":"ptQvq3AM1L","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":3679,"end":3700,"text":"Worldpay (UK) Limited","labels":["Metadata Fields - Parties - Customer Legal Entity Name"]},"id":"dh8fjrIOCQ","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":3995,"end":4021,"text":"MASTER CUSTOMER AGREEMENT ","labels":["Metadata Fields - Agreement Type"]},"id":"dxYR1_i1-1","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":3882,"end":3891,"text":"9\/20\/2019","labels":["Metadata Fields - Effective Date"]},"meta":{"text":["20-Sep-2019"]},"id":"rA2ycR2NA-","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":30453,"end":30483,"text":"or a period of five (5) years.","labels":["Metadata Fields - Expiry Date (Date format)"]},"meta":{"text":["19-sep-2024"]},"id":"QhsPwU_wZ4","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":1182,"end":1202,"text":"TOTAL: GBP 47,700.00","labels":["Metadata Fields - Total Contract Value"]},"id":"uHg9-hNiOE","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":33163,"end":33240,"text":"U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, ","labels":["Metadata Fields - Applicable Anti-Bribery Laws"]},"id":"TSIyRDH7q2","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":59432,"end":59476,"text":"European General Data Protection Regulation.","labels":["Metadata Fields - Applicable Data Protection Laws"]},"id":"TAnHcdmfVU","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":28058,"end":28958,"text":" IN NO EVENT SHALL ELASTIC’S TOTAL, CUMULATIVE LIABILITY UNDER ANY ORDER FORM EXCEED THE HIGHER OF £150,000 OR THE AMOUNT PAID BY CUSTOMER TO ELASTIC UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH ORDER FORM IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE FIRST EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY.

This Agreement is a master agreement that includes terms and conditions applicable to each Addendum. In order for Customer to purchase specific Subscriptions and\/or Services, Customer and Elastic must first execute an Addendum applicable to such Subscriptions and\/or Services. Once executed by both parties, each Addendum becomes part of, and is subject to the terms and conditions of, this Agreement. Customer may then order the Subscriptions and\/or Services covered by a given Addendum as set forth in Section 2.2 below. 2.2 Subscriptions and Services Orders. (a) Initial Orders. Orders for Subscriptions and\/or Services may be placed by Customer and\/or Affiliates through (1) the execution of Order Forms with Elastic, setting forth, as applicable, the (i) Subscription Level, (ii) quantitative and other limitations applicable to a Subscription, (iii) Subscription Term, (iv) specific Services included, where applicable, and (v) total price for such Subscription. (b) Additions and Upgrades to Subscriptions. Customer may add to Subscriptions, and\/or upgrade the Subscription Level for an existing Subscription, by executing one or more additional Order Forms setting forth the details of such addition and\/or upgrade, and referencing the Order Form under which the Subscription was initially purchased. Upon execution of such an Order Form by the parties, the additions and\/or upgrade, will be deemed added to the applicable Subscription for the remainder of the applicable Subscription Term, or, if so indicated on the Order Form, a new Subscription and Subscription Term may be initiated, that includes the addition and\/or upgrade, and Customer will be provided with a credit for the unused portion of the existing Subscription. 2.3 Affiliates. The parties agree that their respective Affiliates may also conduct business under this Agreement by entering into Order Forms, subject to such additional and\/or alternative terms and conditions to those contained in this Agreement as may be mutually agreed upon in order to comply with local country law or business practices, and which are set forth in an applicable participation agreement, executed by the applicable parties which incorporates the v112118.0 - Master Customer Agreement - ES Ltd DocuSign Envelope ID: 4EA81129-2F7E-4823-883C-8FCFD6A2BDC8 terms and conditions of this Agreement, as amended by the terms of the participation (“Participation Agreement”). Accordingly, where Affiliates of the parties conduct business hereunder, references to Customer herein shall include any applicable Customer Affiliate, and references to Elastic herein shall include any applicable Elastic Affiliate. The parties agree that where either of them or one of their Affiliates enters into an Order Form with an Affiliate of the other party, that such Affiliate shall be solely responsible for performing all of its obligations under this Agreement in connection with such Order Form. 2.4 Subscriptions and Services Purchased Through Resellers. The parties agree that Customer may purchase through Resellers Subscriptions and\/or Services that are governed by this Agreement. Orders for Subscriptions purchased through a Reseller, including multi¬ year Subscriptions, are not subject to cancellation by Customer. Where Customer purchases a Subscription and\/or Services through a Reseller, the Reseller will enter into an Order Form with Elastic for the purchase of a Subscription and\/or Services that shows Customer as the “ship to” party and Reseller as the “bill to” party, and Reseller and Customer will enter into a separate agreement setting forth the fees to be paid by Customer to Reseller for such Subscription and\/or Services, as well as any other terms or conditions that apply between them. Elastic hereby agrees that, subject to receiving payment from the Reseller, it shall be responsible to Customer, pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, for providing the Subscriptions and\/or Services under any such Order Form. Customer hereby acknowledges that Elastic will not be responsible for the obligations of any Reseller to Customer under such separate agreement, for the acts or omissions of Reseller, or for any third party products or services furnished to Customer by any Reseller. For the avoidance of doubt, Sections 3.1 and 3.2 below will be of no effect where Customer purchases a Subscription and\/or Services through a Reseller, as payment and taxes will be addressed in the agreement between Reseller and Customer. 3 PAYMENT AND TAXES 3.1 Payment. Customer agrees to pay Elastic the fees stated on each Order Form within thirty (30) days after receipt of an applicable invoice. All invoices will be paid in the currency set forth on the applicable Order Form. Payments will be made without right of set-off or chargeback. If Customer does not pay the undisputed invoices when due, Elastic may charge interest at the lesser of one percent (1%) per month on the unpaid balance or the highest percentage allowed under applicable law. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, any and all payments made by Customer pursuant to this Agreement or any Order Form are non-refundable, and all commitments to make any payments hereunder or under any Order Form are non- cancellable. 3.2 Taxes. All fees stated on an Order Form are exclusive of any applicable sales, use, value added and excise taxes levied upon the delivery or use of the taxable components, if any, of any Subscription purchased by Customer under this Agreement (collectively, “Taxes”). Taxes do not include any taxes on the net income of Elastic or any of its Affiliates. Customer will pay and be solely responsible for all Taxes. If Customer is required by any foreign governmental authority to deduct or withhold any portion of the amount invoiced for the delivery or use of Support Services or the Products and\/or Services under this Agreement, Customer shall increase the sum paid to Elastic by an amount necessary for the total payment to Elastic equal to the amount originally invoiced. 4 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION 4.1 Confidential Information.

Confidential Information also includes any notes, summaries, analyses of the foregoing that are prepared by the receiving party. 4.2 Non-use and Non-disclosure. The parties shall at all times, both during the Term and thereafter keep in trust and confidence all Confidential Information of the other party using commercially reasonable care (but in no event less than the same degree of care that the receiving party uses to protect its own Confidential Information) and shall not use such Confidential Information other than as necessary to carry out its duties under this Agreement, nor shall either party disclose any such Confidential Information to third parties other than to Affiliates or as necessary to carry out its duties under this Agreement without the other party’s prior written consent, provided that each party shall be allowed to disclose Confidential Information of the other party to the extent that such disclosure is approved in writing by such other party, or necessary to enforce its rights under this Agreement. 4.3 Non-Applicability. The obligations of confidentiality shall not apply to information which (i) has entered the public domain or is otherwise publicly available, except where such entry or availability is the result of a party’s breach of this Agreement; (ii) prior to disclosure hereunder was already in the receiving party’s possession without restriction as evidenced by appropriate documentation; (iii) subsequent to disclosure hereunder is obtained by the receiving party on a non- confidential basis from a third party who has the right to disclose such information; or (iv) was developed by the receiving party without any use of any of the Confidential Information as evidenced by appropriate documentation. 4.4 Terms of this Agreement. Except as required by law or governmental regulation, neither party shall disclose, advertise, or publish the terms and conditions of this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party, except that either party may disclose the terms of this Agreement to potential investors, potential acquirers, accountants, attorneys and parent organizations pursuant to the terms of a non-disclosure or confidentiality agreement. 4.5 Disclosure Required by Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, each party may disclose the other party’s Confidential Information in order to comply with applicable law and\/or an order from a court or other governmental body of competent jurisdiction, and, in connection with compliance with such an order only, if such party: (i) unless prohibited by law, gives the other party prior written notice to such disclosure if the time between that order and such disclosure reasonably permits or, if time does not permit, gives the other party written notice of such disclosure promptly after complying with that order and (ii) fully cooperates with the other party, at the other party’s cost and expense, in seeking a protective order, or confidential treatment, or taking other measures to oppose or limit such disclosure. Each party must not release any more of the other party’s Confidential Information than is, in the opinion of its counsel, reasonably necessary to comply with an applicable order. 5 WARRANTIES AND DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES 5.1 Limited Support Services and Services Performance Warranty.

Customer understands and agrees that any features or functions of Products referenced on any Elastic website, or in any presentations, press releases or public statements, which are not currently available or not currently available as a GA release, may not be delivered on time or at all. The development, release, and timing of any features or functionality described for Elastic’s Products remains at Elastic’s sole discretion. Accordingly, Customer agrees that it is purchasing Products based solely upon features and functions that are currently available as of the time an Order Form is executed, and not in expectation of any future feature or function. 9.8 Governing Law, Jurisdiction and Venue. The parties intend that no term of the contract made by this Agreement may be enforced by any person who is not a party to it (except that the Customer may enforce on behalf of its Affiliates).

Subject to its obligations under Section 4 of this Agreement (Confidential Information), Elastic will be free to use, irrevocably, in perpetuity and for any purpose, all suggestions, ideas and\/or feedback (collectively, “Feedback”) provided to Elastic by Customer, or its Affiliates and their respective employees, contractors or other agents, with respect to the Products and\/or Services. The foregoing grant of rights is made without any duty to account to any of the foregoing persons or entities for the use of such Feedback. 9.14 Entire Agreement; Amendment. This Agreement, together with any Order Forms executed by the parties, and the Support Services Policy, each of which is hereby incorporated herein by this reference, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties concerning the subject matter hereof, and it supersedes, and its terms govern, all prior proposals, agreements, or other communications between the parties, oral or written, regarding such subject matter. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed an original, and all of which together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Execution of a scanned copy will have the same force and effect as execution of an original, and a scanned signature will be deemed an original and valid signature. In the event of any conflict between the terms and conditions of any of the foregoing documents, the conflict shall be resolved based on the following order of precedence: (i) an applicable Order Form (but only for the transaction thereunder), (ii) an Applicable Addendum, (iii) this Agreement, and (iv) the Support Services Policy. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereby expressly acknowledge and agree that if Customer issues any purchase orders or similar documents in connection with its purchase of a Subscription and\/or Services, it shall do so only for the purpose of Section 2.2(a)(2) or for its own internal, administrative purposes and not with the intent to provide any contractual terms. By entering into this Agreement, whether prior to or following receipt of Customer’s purchase order or any similar document, the parties are hereby expressly showing their intention not to be contractually bound by the contents of any such purchase order or similar document, which are hereby deemed rejected and extraneous to this Agreement, and Elastic’s performance of this Agreement shall not amount to: (i) an acceptance by conduct of any terms set out or referred to in the purchase order or similar document; (ii) an amendment of this Agreement, nor (iii) an agreement to amend this Agreement. This Agreement shall not be modified except by a subsequently dated, written amendment that expressly amends this Agreement and which is signed on behalf of Elastic and Customer by their duly authorized representatives. The parties agree that the terms and conditions of this Agreement are a result of mutual negotiations. Therefore, the rule of construction that any ambiguity shall apply against the drafter is not applicable and will not apply to this Agreement. Any ambiguity shall be reasonably construed as to its fair meaning and not strictly for or against one party regardless of who authored the ambiguous language. In Witness Whereof, the parties have executed this Agreement by their duly authorized representatives.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, use of the Third Party Open Source Software shall be subject to the license terms and conditions applicable to such Third Party Open Source Software, to the extent required by the applicable licensor (which terms shall not restrict the license rights granted to Customer hereunder, but may contain additional rights). 1.4 Reporting use of Excess Billable Nodes. Customer agrees to promptly notify Elastic in writing if it uses a Gold or Platinum level Subscription in connection with more Billable Nodes than the number of Billable Nodes for which Customer has purchased such Subscription (“Excess Billable Nodes”). Customer shall include in such notice the number of Excess Billable Nodes and the date on which it first used any such Excess Billable Nodes. Elastic will invoice Customer, or, if applicable, a Reseller, for such Excess Billable Nodes in accordance with the charges set out in the Order Form, adjusted on a pro rata basis from the date of first use and for the remainder of the applicable Subscription Term 1.5 Self-Certification.

In addition, Customer agrees to not: (a) use the Support Services to supply any consulting, support or training services regarding the Software to any third party other than Customer Affiliates; (b) use the Support Services to obtain support for Customer’s use of any Community Software that is being hosted by a third party providing such Community Software as a service (provided, that this prohibition shall not prohibit Customer from running the Software on physical or virtual systems hosted by a third party, where the third party provides compute, storage or other infrastructure services to Customer, but does not provide the Community Software or its features and functions to Customer as part of such services); or (c) use Support Services to obtain support (i) for its use of Community Software in a Project for which no Subscription has been purchased or (ii) under a higher Subscription Level for its use of Software in a Project for which Customer has purchased a lower Subscription Level. Customer agrees that any knowing failure to comply with the terms of this Section 2.3 will be deemed a material breach of this Agreement. In the event of any failure to comply this Section 2.3, Elastic may, without prejudice to any other remedies available hereunder, at law or in equity, suspend the provision of Support Services to Customer if Customer fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice thereof. 3 PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA Elastic does not seek or require, and Customer shall use commercially reasonable efforts not to provide Elastic with, access to (or the means to access) Customer Personal Data. If Elastic is nonetheless granted access to, or acquires the means to access, Customer Personal Data, then (i) Elastic shall promptly notify Customer that this is the case; and (ii) Elastic shall promptly and securely return all such Customer Personal Data as are in its 2 possession or under its control to Customer, and Customer and Elastic shall cooperate to terminate such access. \"Personal Data” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (or, to the extent that applicable Data Privacy Laws apply to information about legal persons, an identified or identifiable legal person); \"Customer Personal Data\" means Personal Data owned, licensed, or otherwise controlled by Customer (including data maintained by Customer or Customer' Affiliate(s) on behalf of a third party), but does not include Personal Data relating to Customer personnel that is obtained by Elastic in the ordinary course of maintaining its business relationship with Customer; and “Data Privacy Law\" means a data protection, privacy or confidentiality law or regulation in any relevant jurisdiction, including, without limitation, the European General Data Protection Regulation. 4 ADDITIONAL DEFINITIONS Capitalized terms used herein have the meaning set forth in the Agreement or ascribed below, or where such terms are first used, as applicable. 4.1 “Billable Nodes” means, with respect to a Subscription, a number that is the greater of (i) the number of Nodes running across all Projects covered by the Subscription or (ii) the total GB of RAM addressable by all Nodes across all Projects covered by the Subscription divided by 128, with any fractional remainder being rounded up to the next whole number.

As referenced either in the proprietary license agreement under which you obtain and are granted the right to use Elastic's commercial software and\/or the agreement under which you obtain a subscription (\"Subscription\") to Elastic's support services (in each case, the \"Agreement\"), this Support Services Policy sets forth Elastic's support terms and conditions, as well as provides a description of Elastic's technical support levels. Capitalized terms not defined herein have the definition set forth in the applicable Agreement. 1. Scope of Support Services. The scope of the Support Services provided to Customer includes general assistance and support regarding the installation of the Software and basic technical configuration of the Software, as well as developer assistance on how to use the Software. Elastic will provide Support Services to Customer in accordance with this Support Services Policy, for the number of Projects\/Applications and\/or Nodes set forth in an applicable Order Form, where \"Node\" means a data\/master\/tribe node Elastic instance, and \"Project\/Application\" means a logical grouping of functionality which Elastic nodes are being used for.

Elastic shall use commercially reasonable efforts to meet the applicable targeted response times set forth below. Customer acknowledges that the time required for resolution of issues may vary depending on the specific circumstances of each problem, including, without limitation, the nature of the incident\/problem, the extent and accuracy of information available about the incident\/problem, and the level of Customer's cooperation and responsiveness in providing materials, information, access and support reasonably required by Elastic to achieve problem resolution. Elastic addresses problem resolutions through a number of mechanisms. 3. Subscription Levels. For all support requests, send an email to support@elastic.co or via our support portal. In either case, the submission needs to be prior to engaging an Elastic resource. Once the appropriate support request is filed, the most optimal method of contact may be utilized (phone, web, email), subject to the applicable Subscription Level. Severity Level 1 and 2 issues must be filed via the web-based support portal. Severity Level 3 issues may be filed via email or the web-based support portal. All e-mail based production tickets will be treated as Severity Level 3. Defined Terms: \"Business Day\" means Monday through Friday other than a day designated from time to time as a national holiday in the place from which Support Services may be provided. \"Incident\" means a single question or issue posed by a Support Contact using the Support Services. \"Support Contact\" means a single named individual that is authorized to contact Elastic to make use of the Support Services.

Severity Level Definitions. Level 1 A Level 1 issue is a major production error within the software that severely impacts the Customer's use of the software for production purposes, such as the loss of production data or where production systems are not functioning and no work-around exists. Elastic will use continuous efforts during the Normal Hours of Operation stated above for the applicable Subscription level to provide a resolution for any Level 1 errors as soon as is commercially reasonable. Level 2 A Level 2 issue is an error within the software where the customer's system is functioning for production purposes but in a reduced capacity, such as a problem that is causing significant impact to portions of the customer's business operations and productivity, or where the software is exposed to potential loss or interruption of service. Elastic will use continuous efforts during the Normal Hours of Operation stated above for the applicable Subscription level to provide a resolution for any Level 2 errors. Level 3 A Level 3 issue is a medium-to-low impact error that involves partial and\/or non-critical loss of functionality for production purposes or development purposes, such as a problem that impairs some operations but allows the customer's 9 v111818.0 - Self-Managed Subscription Addendum to MCA - ES Ltd DocuSign Envelope ID: 4EA81129-2F7E-4823-883C-8FCFD6A2BDC8 operations to continue to function. Errors for which there is limited or no loss or functionality or impact to the customer's operation and for which there is an easy work-around qualify as Level 3. Elastic will use reasonable efforts to provide a resolution for any Level 3 error in time for an upcoming release of Software. All inbound production email cases shall have an initial status of Level 3. 5. Customer Obligations. Customer must provide a functional Project\/Application description at time of order to clearly define the Project\/Application Elastic will be supporting. Customer is responsible for ensuring that its personnel that interact with Elastic have sufficient English language and technical skills, and respond to and cooperate with Elastic in a timely manner in connection to requests for Support Services. As a precondition for requesting Support Services from Elastic, Customer agrees to (and to cause each of its developers to) use reasonable efforts to: (i) attempt to solve the problem and to utilize sufficient resources to clearly understand that a problem exists before consulting Elastic; (ii) provide Elastic with sufficient information and technical data in order for Elastic to establish that a potential problem is not the kind of problem that is an exclusion from the Support Services; (iii) make reasonable attempts and expend reasonable resources to provide any data reasonably requested by Elastic to adequately address the potential problem; (iv) utilize sufficient resources to understand the instructions from Elastic in addressing the problem, and make reasonable attempts to correct the problem as suggested by Elastic. In addition, Customer agrees and acknowledges that the extent of access and the accuracy of information and technical data provided may affect Elastic's ability to provide the Support Services. CUSTOMER AGREES NOT TO USE THE SUPPORT SERVICES IN CONNECTION WITH THE DEVELOPMENT, DEPLOYMENT, ENABLEMENT AND\/OR MAINTENANCE OF ANY NON-ELASTIC SOFTWARE THAT COMPETES WITH ELASTIC'S COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE PRODUCTS. 6. Support Service Exclusions. Elastic will have no obligation to provide Support Services to Customer in the event that (i) the Software has been changed, modified or damaged by Customer or anyone other than Elastic, (ii) the problem is caused by Customer's negligence, misconduct, or misuse of the Software, a hardware malfunction, or other causes beyond the reasonable control of Elastic, (iii) the problem is due to third party software, (iv) the Software is being hosted by a third party that is offering the Software as a service (v) Customer has not installed or implemented any Software releases made generally available or is not running a then supported version of the Software as provided by Elastic as defined in Section 7 or (vi) information requested by Customer could reasonably be expected to assist in the development, deployment, enablement and\/or maintenance of any non-Elastic software that competes with Elastic's commercial software products. The Support Services do not cover the support of any third party software which integrates with the Software. In addition, the Support Services do not include the following: (a) use of any version of a Software that is not designated as a production release (such as a milestone or release candidate or code contained in the sandbox or any other repository that is not packaged into a production release distribution); (b) Customer's failure to comply with operating instructions contained in the documentation; (c) installation, configuration, management and operation of Customer's applications; (d) APIs, interfaces or data formats other than those included with the Software; or (e) any training. In addition, Development Level Support Services are available only for one Project\/Application per Agreement and may not be used at all for Production systems where \"Production\" means the system is using\/processing live data. 7. Version Support. Elastic will provide Support Services as follows: 7.1 A three-place numbering scheme is used to designate released versions of the Software. The format is R.V.M, where 'R' indicates the Release level, 'V' indicates the Version level, and 'M' indicates the Maintenance Fix level. An example would be version 5.0.1. Often in referring to general Software versions and releases, the maintenance level is omitted. For example, both 5.0.1 and 5.0.2 may sometimes be referred to as Version 5.0. Each Release and the associated Versions will be supported for eighteen (18) months from the date the Version is initially released. Support for each Version is supplied via Maintenance Fixes.

AGREED AND ACCEPTED; CANDLE CORPORATION By:  y - ; Name: Margo Woodard  Title: Director Financial Operations Date: January 15, 1992 AGREED AND ACCEPTED; SYSTEMATICS, INCORPORATED Exhibit A PRICING ADDENDUM This PRICING ADDENDUM is a part of the Master Software License Agreement (MSLA) between Candle Corporation and Systematics, Incorporated. Candle agrees to provide special pricing considerations and discounts for products licensed by Systematics. The discounts set forth in this PRICING ADDENDUM are for the benefit of Systematics and each subsidiary thereof which orders Candle products pursuant to this agreement. The commencement date of this Pricing Addendum is May 1, 1991. - ■ This PRICING ADDENDUM covers all current Candle Products in general release and all future Candle products generally released. The attached Exhibit A is Candle’s current - published price list and Exhibit B is the price list for Systematics and has been calculated directly from Exhibit A by taking 67.5% of the Exhibit A price. Both Exhibit A and Exhibit B are effective as of the commencement date of this Pricing Addendum. Systematics agrees to designate one site to serve as a 1st site, 1st CPU site. Candle agrees to waive the 1st site, 1st CPU price for this site and agrees to license all products to Systematics at one price per CPU group. ■ ■ • . , In consideration of $10.0,000 of annual license volume for Candle products, Candle will apply . a 20% discount to Exhibit B. In the event that Systematics does not meet an average annual volume of $100,000, Candle reserves the option to terminate the 20% discount for future purchases upon 90 day written notice. These discounts also apply to CPU group upgrade charges. In the event Systematics upgrades to a CPU that is in the same CPU group category designated by Candle at the time of purchase, there will be no additional charge and there shall be no additional notification required. Following the warranty period, annual maintenance charges will be billed at 20% of the Exhibit B price less discounts calculated on the initial license price. Candle agrees that we will not increase the annual maintenance fees by more than 10% per year for a period of 5 years following the commencement date of this addendum. Thereafter, Candle reserves the right to increase maintenance by 10% per year or a rate equivalent to the Consumer Price Index, whichever is greater. In the event of a license transfer, Candle agrees to apply the paid-up maintenance to the Systematics client provided the client has signed a one year maintenance agreement. The License fees in Exhibit A and Exhibit B and the accompanying maintenance charges are subject to change upon ninety (90) days prior written notice by Candle to Systematics. Candle agrees to provide a revised Exhibit A and Exhibit B to Systematics at such time any change occurs. Candle agrees to provide one copy of its products for demonstration\/development to Systematics at no charge for the purpose of integration of the Candle products into the Systematics’ operation and for testing the Candle products for field use. Systematics agrees not to use the product for any production purposes. Candle products may be licensed by Systematics by issuing a firm order letter. Candle will accept a firm order letter in lieu of a purchase order provided the letter contains a reference to the MSLA the site identification, the CPU model and serial number, each product ordered, the price, the commencement date for usage of the product and the terms of payment.

Current licensing costs, subject to change, covered by the Services Agreement for the tool are as follows: • A monthly subscription fee of $15,000 that covers 250 users. • For more users, a fee of $50 per month per user would be applicable in addition to the monthly subscription fee. • A 10% discount is available if the subscription fee is paid in full for the agreed term. Fees paid in full are non-refundable and cannot be pro-rated. • Applicable taxes are extra and will be the responsibility of the licensee. 6. At the end of this engagement if the Client does not choose to execute a standalone Services Agreement for continued access to the tool, the contents maintained in the tool will be archived and a full extract in one of the applicable Microsoft formats (PowerPoint, or Excel) will be provided to the Client. There is no additional cost for this one-time full extract service. V. Change Orders The scope of the Services as documented herein shall remain unchanged, except as otherwise agreed by Deloitte Consulting and Client in writing. If any of the following events occur while Deloitte Consulting is engaged to provide the Services (each a \"Change Order Event\"), Deloitte Consulting shall be entitled to request that the parties to alter the Fixed Fee (a \"Change Order\") to compensate it for actual and anticipated additional effort at Deloitte Consulting standard billing rates, plus reasonable incurred expenses: onfidential 9 DocuSign Envelope ID: C000A3B8-D109-44E2-8811-5654D769CF2C • The scope, approach or timing of the Project or the Services change at Client's request • Delays are encountered that are beyond the reasonable control of Deloitte Consulting, (excluding a Force Majeure) that would materially impact the Fixed Fee, • A project assumption proves to be invalid, • Client fails to meet its obligations as set forth herein in some material respect. Deloitte Consulting will notify Client in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of a Change Order Event. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Engagement Letter, if the parties are unable to reach a complete agreement on a Change Order within thirty (30) days of Client being notified of a Change Order Event, Deloitte Consulting will continue to provide the Services as originally described in this Engagement Letter.. Change Orders to this Engagement Letter will only be effective when signed by authorized representatives of each party. VI. Fees, Expenses and Payment Terms Deloitte Consulting will perform the Services on a fixed fee basis of $350,000 (the \"Fixed Fee”). This fee is based on both parties' discussions and on the information provided to Deloitte Consulting as of the date of this Engagement Letter, the nature and scope of the Services and Deliverables, the expected resource requirements of Deloitte Consulting, the resource commitments from Client, the anticipated timeline of the Services, and the assumptions made in connection with this Engagement Letter, each as described in this Engagement Letter. This fee also reflects a one-time Deloitte strategic investment of $181,250 in this opportunity given the longer-term collaboration on Prism transition and longer-term Utility partnership. Deloitte Consulting does not anticipate incurring travel or related fees on this engagement. However, Deloitte Consulting will not incur travel related expenses without prior notification of Client. Deloitte Consulting will not incur travel or related fees in excess of 15% without first obtaining Client's approval, and Deloitte Consulting will not be obligated to continue to provide the Services or complete the Deliverables unless an agreement is reached by both parties as to additional fees and expenses.

If Client's use of any such Deliverable, or any portion thereof, is or is likely to be enjoined by order of a court of competent jurisdiction as such an infringement or unauthorized use, Deloitte Consulting, at its option and expense, shall have the right to (x) procure for Client the continued use of such Deliverable, (y) replace such Deliverable with a non-infringing Deliverable, or (z) modify such Deliverable so it becomes non-infringing; provided that, if (y) or (z) is the option chosen by Deloitte Consulting, the replacement or modified Deliverable is capable of performing substantially the same function.
