Interpretation and Application of Terms 1.1. The provision by Control Risks of its services (the “Services”) to a client (the \"Client”) is subject to these terms and conditions (the \"Terms and Conditions”). 1.2. “Control Risks” shall refer to the contracting party in the Control Risks Group. \"Control Risks Group\" shall be defined as Control Risks Group Holdings Limited, its subsidiaries, branches and affiliates. “Client Group” shall refer to the Client, its holding company or companies, and their respective subsidiaries, branches and affiliates. 1.3. These Terms and Conditions, together with the terms of any proposal (the \"Proposal” and, together, the \"Agreement”), set out the entire agreement and understanding of the parties and supersede all prior oral and written agreements, negotiations, understandings or arrangements between the parties relating to the subject matter of the Proposal and, unless otherwise agreed, any extension thereof. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms of the Proposal and these Terms and Conditions, these Terms and Conditions shall prevail. 1.4. The Agreement shall be deemed to be effective as of the date of signature by the Client hereof. 1.5. Unless instructed otherwise, Control Risks shall assume that all of the Client's employees, directors and officers who give instructions to Control Risks are authorised to do so and that Control Risks may act on oral instructions. 2. Services 2.1. The Services to be provided in relation to any matter will be described in the terms of the Proposal and may be varied only by written agreement between the parties during the course of the matter. The Services shall be provided at times, on dates and at the place(s) as agreed between Control Risks and the Client from time to time. 2.2. Control Risks shall provide the Services using reasonable care and skill. 2.3. Control Risks reserves the right to make changes to the Services which are necessary to comply with statutory requirements or which do not materially affect the nature or quality of the Services. 2.4.

Reports (where they form part of the Services) will be delivered in PDF format by email, unless otherwise specified by the Client, in which case the Client shall cover any additional costs that may be incurred.

If the Client is required to deduct or withhold from the amount due to Control Risks any sum on -9- Prepared by Control Risks For WORLDPAY account of taxes or charges, the fees will be increased by the amount of such taxes or charges such that Control Risks will receive an amount equal to the original fees which would have been due under this Agreement if no tax deduction or withholding had been required. 4.2. The Client shall reimburse Control Risks all reasonably and properly incurred travel, accommodation, subsistence and other out-of-pocket expenses, relating to the provision of the Services, which shall be billed at cost as disbursements.

Fees will be payable in the British pounds sterling. 4.5. In the event the Client cancels the provision of Services at any point in time (whether or not such cancellation is concurrent with a formal termination of the Agreement), Control Risks shall invoice the Client for any fees and\/or expenses incurred to date and the Client shall settle the invoice in accordance with this paragraph 4. 4.6. If any amount owed by the Client to Control Risks remains outstanding for more than thirty (30) days after the date of the relevant invoice, then until all amounts have been paid, Control Risks reserves the right to cease providing the Services with immediate effect and to retain documents and papers belonging to the Client until such time as any outstanding amounts have been paid in full. 5.

Whilst those discussions are continuing, although it is the intention of the parties to enter a definitive separate agreement setting out the terms and conditions that would apply to the Service should it proceed (the \"Agreement\"), the parties hereby agree to establish a \"proof of concept\" (\"POC\") arrangement under which testing of the Service and Its associated performance levels may commence. Parti: Joint Activities The purposes of the POC tests are to determine whether the Service is capable of providing an effective cloud based automated pen testing capability, during the tests only the web and email modules of the product will be used. Worldpay will provide a single virtual IP host in its test wDesk environment with which to install the initial agent and a Worldpay mailbox, this agent is only required for the initial installation and to configure elements to converse with the cloud portal The Virtual Machine (VM) utilized for this purpose will be decommissioned and erased after the POC. This will then be used to facilitate the Cloud service which will deliver and execute the tests, the POC takes approximately 40 minutes to run once the host has been provisioned and Cymulate will be present to assist in the exercise and tailor the execution to drive the greatest visibility and benefit for Worldpay. The POC will deliver a report on both web and email attacks that the Worldpay environment are currently susceptible to, generate a list of recommended remediation actions which will be reviewed by Worldpay's Cyber Security team and an action plan put in place to correct. This POC is an urgent requirement that needs completing within the next 7 days depending on Cymulate's availability which has already been reserved on standby. The success of the POC will be determined by the granularity of attack vectors identified in the report, the usability of the Graphical User Interface (GUI) and effectiveness of the remediation plans created by the solution, ultimately success is determined in Worldpay's sole discretion. Part 2: Binding Provisions 1. Confidentiality A J 6\/ y616473890 During the course of discussions relating to the Service, the parties may each disclose to the other information related to their businesses which is clearly marked or should reasonably be recognized as confidential (\"Confidential information\"). Each party agrees to protect the Confidential Information of the other in the same manner as it would protect its own confidential information of like kind, but in no event using less than a reasonable standard of care. For purposes of this Letter of Intent, Confidential Information will Include information provided by one party to the other prior to the date of this Letter of Intent in regards to the POC, but will not Include Information that was independently developed by the receiving party without use of or access to information provided by the other (disclosing) party, information that was received from a third party without obligation to keep the information confidential, or information that becomes part of the public domain through no breach of this provision. If either party receives a court or administrative order requiring it to disclose the Confidential Information of the other party, it will to the extent permitted, first notify the disclosing party, and then will be entitled to comply with such order. Each party will return or destroy the other party's Confidential Information in its possession upon request by the other party, unless otherwise allowed to retain such Confidential Information. Each party may retain copies of the other party's Confidential Information required for compliance with its recordkeeping or quality assurance requirements (subject to the terms of this Letter of Intent). 2.

Licensee shall allow CMSI reasonable access to all production copies of the Program for purposes of counting transaction volumes in accordance with Exhibit B, Section 2. 2.7 Object Code. This is an object code only license, and entitles Licensee to utilize the Program in object code, machine-readable format. Licensee may write independent routines that access the Program’s database provided that such routines are restricted to read-only access to the database. Licensee is not entitled under this License Agreement to obtain the Source Code unless: (i) CMSI and Licensee agree in writing to amend this License Agreement to allow Licensee to access the Source Code, and the Licensee agrees to pay all additional fees and to observe all limitations with respect to the Source Code required by CMSI, or (ii) the Source Code is released to Licensee as specified in Section 2.8 below. 2.8 Source Code Escrow by CMSI. CMSI will escrow with a reputable escrow agent to be identified in writing by CMSI to DealerTrack prior to the Acceptance Date (“Source Code Escrow Agent”) the Source Code in machine-readable format of the then-current version of the Program along with technical documentation, design specifications and all other information and materials reasonably necessary to enable programmers of reasonable skill and experience to operate and use the Program (such additional materials, together with the Source Code, the “Escrow Materials”) on or before three (3) months following the Effective Date. Thereafter and for the term of this License Agreement, CMSI will escrow the Source Code of the then-current version of the Program and any subsequent scheduled releases of the Program along with any other updated Escrow Materials within sixty (60) days of.the release date (the “Source Code Escrow”). The Source Code Escrow shall remain in escrow with Source Code Escrow Agent for the term of this License Agreement. CMSl’s obligations under this Section 2.8 are conditional upon the execution of a Source Code Escrow Agreement among CMSI, Licensee and Source Code Escrow Agent, consistent with the terms of this section 2.8 and reasonably agreed to by the Parties and Licensee’s timely payment to Source Code Escrow Agent of all fees required thereunder. The Source Code Escrow Agreement shall provide that the escrow agent shall release the Source Code Escrow to Licensee in the event that (i) CMSI is liquidated, dissolved or adjudged to be in a state of bankruptcy or receivership, (ii) CMSI makes an assignment to or for the benefit of its creditors, (iii) CMSI declares bankruptcy or an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding is commenced with respect to CMSI and is not dismissed within sixty (60) days of its filing, or (iv) CMSI fails to materially perform its obligations under the Maintenance Agreement despite Licensee’s compliance with all material terms and conditions of the Maintenance Agreement and Licensee consequently terminates the Maintenance Agreement due to CMSl’s material uncured breach, subject to the following additional conditions: (1) the Source Code Escrow shall not be released unless Licensee makes a written demand to Source Code Escrow Agent for release, with a copy to CMSI, and pays Source Code Escrow Agent’s reasonable material and processing costs; (2) CMSI, or its trustee or other agent, shall have five (5) business days after receipt of Licensee’s written demand for release (the “Notice Period”) to object to such release, (3) if such objection is made within the Notice Period, CMSI (7\/2\/2010) Confidential 6 Source Code Escrow Agent shall not release the Source Code Escrow until the dispute is resolved in accordance with the terms of the Source Code Escrow Agreement. Further, CMSI represents that the Source Code Escrow will (a) contain the complete contents of the Source Code Escrow as defined above; (b) correspond in all material respects to the Program licensed to Licensee as defined above; and (c) contain no passwords or other devices designed to prevent the use of the Source Code Escrow by Licensee pursuant to this Section 2.8 and Section 2.9 below. 2.9 Escrow Materials License .CMSI hereby grants to Licensee a non-exclusive, paid-up, royalty-free license to use the Escrow Materials and to develop Licensee Enhancements, solely in accordance with the terms and conditions of this License Agreement (the “Escrow Materials License”), which license rights Licensee may exercise only upon release of the Escrow Materials to Licensee. All of the terms and conditions of this License Agreement governing the Licensed Products shall be fully applicable to the Source Code including but not limited to the Scope of Use provisions of this Section 2 and those lines of business discussed in Exhibit A, Section 2. In addition to the foregoing, Licensee’s use of the Source Code shall be subject to all of the following conditions: (a) The Source Code may be used by Licensee only at the location designated in Exhibit A, Section 3 for the sole purpose of maintaining the Program and its use in accordance with the license granted under this Section 2; and (b) Licensee shall maintain the Source Code in a locked and secure area, and shall make the Source Code available only to those Personnel of Licensee who have both significant data processing responsibilities relating to Licensee’s business and have agreed in writing to the confidentiality and proprietary rights provisions of this License Agreement. Licensee shall be responsible for compliance by its Personnel with the terms and conditions of this License Agreement. (c) Licensee shall continue to pay to CMSI all fees required under the Maintenance Agreement provided that CMSI continues to perform its obligations under the Maintenance Agreement. (d) Licensee shall bear sole responsibility for creation and\/or use of Licensee Enhancements, including but not limited to reimbursement of CMSI for any loss, damage or liability (including but not limited to reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, damages or costs assessed against CMSI, and amounts paid by CMSI pursuant to any settlement agreement) incurred by CMSI in any suit, action or proceeding which arises from violation or infringement by Licensee Enhancements of the patent, copyright or proprietary rights of a third party. Further, Licensee acknowledges that CMSI will not provide support services under the Maintenance Agreement relating to Licensee Enhancements. The Escrow Materials License is, and shall otherwise be deemed to be, for purposes of Section 365(n) of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the “Code”), a license to “intellectual property” as defined under the Code. CMSI acknowledges that if it, as a debtor in possession or a trustee in bankruptcy in a case under the Code, rejects this License Agreement, then Licensee may elect to retain its rights under this License Agreement as provided in Section 365(n) of the Code. The parties further agree that, in the event of the commencement of any bankruptcy proceeding by or against CMSI under the Code, (a) Licensee shall be entitled to retain all of its rights under this License Agreement. CMSI agrees and acknowledges that enforcement by Licensee of any rights under Section 365(n) of the Code in connection with this Agreement shall not violate the automatic stay of Section 362 of the Code and waives any right to object on such basis. Upon rejection of thia Agreement by CMSI or the bankruptcy trustee in a bankruptcy case under the Code and written request of Licensee to CMSI or the bankruptcy trustee pursuant to Section 365(n) of the Code, CMSI or such bankruptcy trustee shall: (a) provide Licensee the Escrow Materials that are the subject of the license described in this Section; and (b) not interfere with the rights of Licensee provided in this License Agreement or any other agreement supplementary to this Agreement, to the Escrow Materials that are the subject of the license described in this Section. For the avoidance of doubt, CMSI shall be and remain and sole and exclusive owner of CMSI (7\/2\/2010) Confidential 7 the Escrow Materials, and Licensee shall only be entitled to its license rights in the Escrow Materials granted by CMSI pursuant to this License Agreement. 3. Implementation. The Parties will implement the Program as follows: 3.1 Project Manager. No later than ten (10) calendar days after the Execution Date, each Party will designate in writing to the other Party, a “Project Manager” to act as its representative for the implementation of the Program. A Party’s Project Manager must have an appropriate level of expertise and the authority to act on the Party’s behalf. A Party may change its Project Manager with prompt written notice to the other Party’s Project Manager. 3.2 Configuration Specifications for Pre-screening and Analytics. Licensee will select its configuration of the Program from CMSI’s standard Program configuration options. No later than thirty (30) days after Licensee makes its selection, CMSI will provide Licensee with a Configuration Specifications Document for Pre-screening and Analytics based on Licensee’s selections. Subject to review and approval, both Parties will execute such Configuration Specifications Document. The signature of Licensee’s Project Manager or of an Officer of Licensee (an “Authorized Person”) on such Configuration Specifications Document confirms that such Configuration Specifications Document accurately states Licensee’s requested configuration for Pre-screening and Analytics. CMSI will configure the Program for Pre-screening and Analytics in accordance with such Configuration Specifications Document and the implementation schedule mutually agreed to by the Parties in the Project Plan established in accordance with Section 3.6 below. An Authorized Person for each Party must sign any change to such Configuration Specifications Document. 3.3 Environment and Migration to Licensee Based Operation. CMSI has hosted the Program at CMSI’s Data Center for a period of time prior to the Acceptance Date of this License Agreement (as defined in Section 3.7 below), and Licensee has used the hosted Program for Verification under an ASP and license agreement with CMSI (the “ASP Agreement”). Licensee’s Execution of this License Agreement indicates a desire by Licensee to migrate the Program from the CMSI Data Center to a “Licensee Hosted” environment where the Program is operated on Licensee’s System. Licensee will procure and maintain the hardware, operating system, and any other hardware, software, telecommunications lines or devices, networks or other equipment or systems (collectively, the “Environment”) necessary for installation or use of the Program on the DealerTrack System. CMSI will reasonably assist Licensee in identifying such preparations. Licensee will be responsible for configuring the Environment as necessary for installation and use of the Program. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this License Agreement, the Environment remains Licensee’s sole responsibility. At Licensee’s option Licensee may migrate the Program hosted from CMSI’s Data Center as of the Execution Date for Verification purposes (the “Accepted Verification Configuration”) to Licensee’s own Data Center either prior to or within sixty (60) days after the Acceptance Date. If Licensee migrates the Accepted Verification Configuration before the Acceptance Date, the Maintenance Agreement shall commence as of the date that Licensee begins to use the migrated Acceptance Verification Configuration for production purposes, and support payments under the Maintenance Agreement shall be correspondingly prorated until the occurrence of the Acceptance Date. Licensee shall have access to the Accepted Verification Configuration hosted from CMSI’s Data Center until the sixtieth (60th) day after the date that Licensee begins to use the migrated Acceptance Verification Configuration for production purposes (such 60th day, the “Migration End Date”).. After the Migration End Date, Licensee shall no longer be entitled to access the Accepted Verification Configuration at CMSI’s Data Center and CMSI will delete all Licensee data from the Accepted Verification Configuration at CMSI’s Data Center. Until the occurrence of the Migration End Date, CMSI will continue to perform the hosting and support services required under the ASP Agreement, and the terms and conditions of the ASP Agreement relating to such hosting and support services are hereby incorporated by reference. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if for any reason Licensee decides not to move forward with migration and to have CMSI host the Program for Licensee, CMSI and Licensee will work together in good faith to execute a hosting agreement or addendum to provide for Licensee’s continued use of the Program hosted at CMSI’s Data Center in accordance with the scope CMSI (7\/2\/2010) Confidential 8 of use set forth in Section 2.1 and to concurrently terminate the Maintenance Agreement. The fees for such hosting services will be as set forth in Exhibit C. 3.4 Installation. Licensee will provide CMSI with access to the Environment as reasonably required by CMSI to complete the installation of the Program so that User Acceptance Testing can be conducted. 3.5 Interfaces. Any interface between the Program, and any External Site, or between the Program and Licensee’s Equipment, must comply with the following: (a) evaluate and Non- ex\/aluate Interfaces. Exhibit A, Section 2 identifies the Program Components that CMSI is providing to Licensee under this License Agreement. If the Program is to be used to interface with entities other than those identified in this License Agreement and Exhibit A hereto, Licensee must obtain a license from CMSI for the unidentified use. CMSI agrees that it will grant Licensee a license for any interface(s) at no additional cost to Licensee to the extent such interface(s) is to be used by Licensee solely to utilize the Program in accordance with the scope of use provided for under Section 2.1 above. In addition, Licensee must use the Program subject to the following: (i) Interface Specifications. An interface must comply with CMSI’s interface specifications as provided to Licensee from time to time, except as otherwise agreed to in writing by CMSI. CMSI may require that any participating Affiliate or Third Party execute an agreement satisfactory to CMSI acknowledging and protecting CMSI’s proprietary and intellectual property rights. Licensee may not disclose CMSI’s interface specifications to any Affiliate or Third Party absent CMSI’s prior written consent. Licensee will cooperate, and will do all things necessary to procure the cooperation of any Affiliate or Third Party in the implementation of the interface by CMSI. However, nothing contained herein prohibits Licensee from disclosing to any Third Party Licensee’s interface specifications used in operating the Program. If Licensee requires additional interfaces not contemplated or licensed by this License Agreement, Licensee will obtain an additional license for such interfaces and CMSI will make such license available to Licensee on commercially reasonable terms. (ii) Additional Equipment. CMSI is not required to provide Licensee with an interface that requires Equipment or a telecommunication line not then used in connection with CMSI’s standard interface. If CMSI agrees in writing to additional Equipment, then CMSI, in its reasonable discretion, will determine whether CMSI or Licensee is responsible for providing the Equipment. If Licensee provides the Equipment: (a) CMSI assumes no responsibility or liability for the Equipment; (b) Licensee is responsible for maintaining any warranty or maintenance contract with the Equipment vendor; (c) CMSI and Licensee must establish with the Equipment vendor that CMSI has the authority to contact the vendor and to requisition repairs and maintenance of the Equipment at Licensee’s expense if CMSI in its sole discretion deems it necessary, and (d) Licensee will pay the Equipment vendor’s fees and expenses. (iii) Interface Fees. If a requested interface deviates materially from an interface already configured or supported functionally by CMSI for Licensee and requires more than eight (8) hours of Professional Service time for implementation, configuration, or testing of such interface, CM SI will require the payment of additional fees as set forth in Exhibit B. In addition, CMSI may require the payment of fees for the operation and\/or CMSI (7\/2\/2010) Confidential 9 maintenance of any interface that deviates materially from an interface already configured or supported functionally by CMSI and requires more than eight (8) hours of Professional Service time. For any interface that requires any additional Equipment or telecommunications line, Licensee is responsible for the cost of acquiring such equipment or services. CMSI may require an Authorized Person to provide a written Task Order before implementing such an interface. Licensee will pay CMSI for its professional services expenses and will either reimburse CMSI for, or, as determined by CMSI, pay directly to the vendor, any actual out-of-pocket costs associated with any Equipment or telecommunications line ordered by Licensee or at Licensee’s request that CMSI is required to use to connect to the interface. 3.6 Project Plan. The Parties will work together in good faith to agree on a written plan (“Project Plan”) identifying the steps necessary for the configuration, delivery, installation, and testing of the Program as well as a transition plan for the migration of the Program as described in Section 3.3. An Authorized Person for each Party will provide written approval of the Project Plan confirming that Party’s acceptance and agreement to the Project Plan. Each Party will make reasonable efforts to satisfy its responsibilities within the time frames set forth in the Project Plan. An Authorized Person for each Party must provide written approval for any change to the Project Plan. CMSI may suspend the Program’s implementation in the event Licensee unreasonably delays the implementation process. 3.7 User Acceptance Testing. (a) As of the Execution Date the Parties agree that the Program is accepted for purposes of Verification. (b) The Project Plan will identify the timeframe within which the Program will be available for User Acceptance Testing relating to Pre-screening and Analytics (“UAT”). Each Party will perform its tasks set forth in the Project Plan in a diligent and timely manner, and CMSI and Licensee agree to work together to complete the UAT processes in a timely manner. CMSI will notify Licensee in writing when the Program is available for UAT. Licensee may conduct UAT for up to thirty (30) calendar days beginning on the day the UAT notice is delivered. The Program is deemed accepted by Licensee upon the termination of the UAT, unless Licensee provides CMSI prior written notice, together with reasonably sufficient supporting data, identifying a Program Error. Upon receiving proper notice, CMSI will correct the Program Error. If necessary, the UAT may be extended for a period of ten (10) calendar days beginning on the first business day after CMSI corrects the Program Error and notifies Licensee in writing or by e-mail that the correction has been made. After the ten (10) days, provided Licensee has not identified and communicated to CMSI notice of additional or continuing Program Error, the UAT is terminated and the Program is deemed accepted by Licensee. If Licensee provides CMSI with additional written or email notice and reasonably sufficient supporting evidence of a Program Error that manifests after the conclusion of the above ten (10) day UAT extension, CMSI will grant additional ten (10) day extensions of the UAT period as necessary to resolve the Program, (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing in Section 3.7(b), even if a Party does not complete the initial UAT process, the Program is deemed accepted by Licensee, and UAT is terminated, the first day Licensee submits data to the Program for Pre-screening production purposes, unless the Parties have agreed that such submission is part of UAT. The date upon which UAT is terminated and the Program is deemed accepted by Licensee for Pre-screening and Analytics is the “Acceptance Date.” (d) The UAT period for any work that CMSI performs for Licensee under a Task Order shall be set forth in that Task Order or a separate written document mutually agreed to by the Parties. 3.8 Licensee Responsibility. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this License Agreement, Licensee remains solely responsible for selection of the Program’s configuration, selection of any interfaces with External Sites, and conduct of UAT. CMSI (7\/2\/2010) Confidential 10 3.9 Support and Maintenance. CMSI will provide support and maintenance services to Licensee under the terms and conditions of the Maintenance Agreement which Licensee must execute concurrently with this License Agreement, and which must remain in effect during the entire Term of this License Agreement. The License granted under this License Agreement automatically terminates if and when such Maintenance Agreement is terminated unless (a) Licensee has obtained the Source Code pursuant to Section 2.8 above, (b) Licensee has terminated the Maintenance Agreement for CMSI’s breach or (c) the parties terminate the Maintenance Agreement in connection with entering into a hosting agreement or addendum as contemplated by Section 3.3. 4.

In addition to the capitalized terms defined in this Exhibit A, capitalized words have the same meaning as in this License Agreement. 2. Program Provisions. The Program provided by CMSI to the Licensee under this License Agreement is as follows: 2.1 The evaluate Pre-screening and Verification functionality, including without limitation Analytics, to be used exclusively as defined in this License Agreement. 2.2 XML integration of DealerTrack platform with the evaluate Program (XML interface). 2.3 eVStudio; 2.4 Configuration Manager tools for configuring parameters of each set of DealerTrack Lender Criterion; 2.5 Releases, updates, upgrades, configurations, enhancements or modifications of the Program which are distributed by CMSI from time to time. 3. Licensee’s Business. Licensee agrees to use the Licensed Products solely for Verification, Analytics, and Pre-screening. 4. As of the Acceptance Date, and excluding the copy of the Program operating from CMSI’s Data Center for Verification, Licensee will maintain copies of the Program exclusively at the following locations: (a) Production Copies:number of copies will be located at: (b) Test Copies number of copies will be located at: (b) Development Copies: number of copies will be located at: (c) Training Copies:number of copies will be located at:  (d) Disaster Recovery Copies:number of copies will be located at: CMSI (7\/2\/2010) Confidential 21 ACCEPTED AND AGREED: CREDIT MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS, INC.

Definitions, Unless otherwise defined in this Exhibit B, the capitalized terms in this Exhibit B have the same meaning as defined in this License Agreement. 2. Program License Fee Computation. Licensee shall pay to CMSI the license fees (“Program License Fees”) in connection with its access to and use of the Program determined in accordance with this Section 2, The Program License Fee will be $500,000 and will include 2,250,000 evaluate Pre-screening, Verification and Analytics transactions per Annual Period (during the initial Annual Period Verification transactions will only be counted for purposes of this Section 2 if they are processed on the Program hosted by Licensee, and not on the Program hosted at CMSI’s Data Center prior to migration of Verification processing from Licensee’s Data Center). These 2,250,000 transactions can be any combination of Pre  screening and\/or Verification transactions. If Licensee exceeds or believes it will exceed the 2,250,000 transactions in an Annual Period, Licensee can either (a) increase the number of transactions by increasing the annual volume by paying a one-time payment of $75,000 for an additional 500,000 annual transactions or (b) pay $0.10 for each evaluate transaction over the number of annual transactions that Licensee has licensed. As an example, if, in a given Annual Period, Licensee exceeds the 2,250,000 transactions by 40,000 transactions, Licensee could just pay CMSI an additional $4,000 within thirty (30) days of the end of such Annual Period. This would allow Licensee the option to determine if the overage is a temporary increase based upon a short term market condition (e.g. Cash for Clunkers) that is not sustainable. For the purposes of this Section 2, one transaction shall be deemed to have occurred if a Credit Application is processed for Pre-Screening, a second transaction shall be deemed to have occurred if that same Credit Application is processed for Analytics to determine to which DealerTrack Lender the Loan should be forwarded for funding and booking, and a third transaction shall be deemed to have occurred if that same Credit Application and the associated Contract Data is processed for Verification. There can be no more than three transactions in connection with a single Credit Application for purposes of counting Licensee’s annual transaction volume. 3. Program License Fee Payments. Licensee will pay the license fees described below (“Program License Fees”) for the license to use the Program. 3.1 Licensee will pay CMSI a one-time Program License Fee in the amount of $500,000 in three (3) installments as follows: (a) $300,000 shall be due and payable upon the Execution Date; (b) $100,000 shall be due and payable upon the date that CMSI delivers the Program to Licensee so that User Acceptance Testing for Pre-screening and Analytics can be conducted; provided, however that, if such delivery has not occurred as of the six (6) month anniversary of the Execution Date and if such delay is primarily caused by Licensee, then $100,000 shall be due and payable on the six (6) month anniversary of the Execution Date; and (c) The final $100,000 shall be due and payable upon the Acceptance Date;, provided, however that, if the Acceptance Date has not occurred as of the six (6) month anniversary of the date that the $100,000 under Section 3.1(b) above became due and payable (the “Section 3.1(b) Payment Due Date”) and if such delay is primarily caused by Licensee, then the final $ 100,000 shall be due and payable on the six (6) month anniversary of the Section 3.1(b) Payment Due Date. CMSI (7\/2\/2010) Confidential 23 3.2 Licensee will pay additional Program License Fees, as determined in accordance with Section 2 above, within thirty (30) days after the Billing Month such additional Program License Fees are incurred. 4. Additional Lenders: 4.1 The Parties acknowledge that, as of the Execution Date, the Program has already been configured to accommodate Verification for the following DealerTrack Lenders: Bank of Hawaii, Eastern Bank, and Nissan Motor Acceptance. 4.2 In the event Licensee requests CMSI to configure DealerTrack Lenders beyond the Verification configuration already performed for the DealerTrack Lenders identified in Section 4,1 above, CMSI will do so for fixed price fee of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000) for Verification per additional DealerTrack Lender provided such configuration is limited to the library of rules existing as of the Execution Date. In the event that Licensee requests CMSI to configure a DealerTrack Lender(s) using a different rule(s) from any existing as of the Execution Date, CMSI shall perform such configuration on a time and materials basis, subject to mutual agreement by the Parties. The fixed price fee of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000) for Verification offered in this Section 4.2 will be subject to annual CPI adjustments as provided in Section 6 below. Licensee retains the right to configure DealerTrack Lenders without the assistance or involvement of CMSI, utilizing the configuration tools that it has licensed under the License Agreement. 4.3 CMSI will provide Licensee with additional configuration and technical support to Licensee on a time and materials basis as set forth in a mutually agreed upon Task Order executed by both Parties. 5. DealerTrack Commission. CMSI will compensate Licensee should a current DealerTrack Lender migrate from the use of Verification via the DealerTrack System, to the use of Verification via an Originate or evaluate license provided directly by CMSI to the DealerTrack Lender. Such compensation will be calculated as Ten Percent (10%) of the Program License Fee allocated to Verification by CMSI. Such compensation shall be paid by CMSI provided the DealerTrack Lender is not a customer of CMSI prior to becoming a DealerTrack Lender. However, CMSI’s allocation of the Program License Fee will not on a percentage basis be less than DealerTrack’s allocation for Verification in its bundled pricing where the components of the Program License Fee include substantially similar products or services to those offered and bundle-priced by DealerTrack, and CMSI’s allocation will be reasonable in relation to industry pricing for Verification if the Program License Fee includes products or services not substantially similar to those offered by DealerTrack. 6. Remote Monitoring Services Option. At Licensee’s option, to be exercised by Licensee within one (1) year after the Acceptance Date, CMSI will provide remote monitoring services for a monthly monitoring fee of $3,250. The exercise of this option requires that CMSI have access to the equipment and production environments for the Program to assist in the problem determination process. Under this option CMSI would be alerted concurrently with Licensee’s technical support personnel. CMSI would require a minimum commitment of six (6) months of remote monitoring, and after the initial six (6) months CMSI would require a ninety (90) days cancelation notice. CMSI anticipates using BMC Patrol in connection with this option, and would be willing to perform the initial configuration of BMC Patrol software for Licensee. In such event Licensee would be required to license BMC Patrol, and CMSI’s price to configure and set up BMC Patrol would be estimated to be between $10,000 and $12,000 for technical consulting. If Licensee decides to use a different software package for monitoring its equipment and production environment, CMSI could provide Technical Consulting services to Licensee on a time and materials basis to ensure the appropriate monitoring is in place. 7. Professional Services. Licensee will pay CMSI at the applicable rate set forth in Exhibit C, as set forth in an applicable Task Order, for professional services provided by CMSI in connection with this License Agreement. CMSI’s rates as of die Execution Date are One Hundred Fifty Five Dollars ($155) per hour per professional for Professional and Configuration Services, and One Hundred Eight Five Dollars ($185) per CMSI (7\/2\/2010) Confidential 24 hour per professional for Technical Consulting services. Rates specified may be adjusted annually in accordance with the consumer price index. For purposes of this Agreement, “CPI” means the “Consumer Price Index for ■ Urban Wage and Clerical Workers (Current Series), as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, United States Department of Labor. 8. Training. If Licensee desires training, CMSI will provide such training at CMSI’s facility in Maryland $1,200 per day for up to four (4) individuals or at Licensee’s facility at $1,600 per day for up to four (4) individuals for such training.

The Parties have agreed that they shall honor the following pricing arrangement, excerpted from the proposal which served as the basis for this License Agreement, in the event that Licensee shall inform CMSI prior to the Migration End Date that Licensee desires CMSI to host the Program for Licensee from a CMSI Data Center: CMSI has hardware capacity to allow Dealer Track to grow the current evaluate transaction volume to 10,000 evaluate transactions per month for a monthly hosting fee of $2,500. If DealerTrack anticipates the monthly evaluate transaction volume will begin to exceed 10,000 on a monthly basis, CMSI will need 60 days advance notice to allow CMSI the time to acquire and set up the new environment(s) for DealerTrack. CMSI will then assess an incremental surcharge of Three Thousand Two Hundred Dollars ($3,200) that will be added to DealerTrack’s Monthly Hosting fee for remainder of the Term. If DealerTrack anticipates that the evaluate transactions will exceed 10,000 per month, CMSI will need a minimum of ten (10) months to recoup the expense of adding the additional equipment. (For example: If DealerTrack is paying $2,500 for up to 10,000 evaluate monthly transactions and DealerTrack expects the evaluate monthly transactions will exceed 10,000, then the total monthly fee will be $5,700 ($2,500 + $3,200 = $5,700) per month for remainder of Term or ten (10) more months.) DealerTrack will need to provide CMSI with 60 days advance notice when they anticipate their evaluate transaction volume will begin to exceed 30,000 a month. At that time, another incremental $3,200 fee will be added as a monthly surcharge to the monthly hosting fee. The total monthly bill will be $8,900 per month for remainder of Term ($2,500 + $3,200 + $3,200 = $8,900). Further, notifications will be required for every additional 20,000 increase in evaluate transactions and the $3200 Tier increase will apply as well as the added term of 10 months,  Print Namc\/Title Date Print Name\/Title   \/V\/°  Date CMSI (7\/2\/2010) Confidential 26 evaluate SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT This evaluate ® Software Maintenance Agreement (the “Maintenance Agreement”) is executed on August 3, 2010 (“Effective Date”) between Credit Management Solutions, Inc., a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business at 8671 Robert Fulton Drive, Suite B Columbia, Maryland 210 (“CMSI”), and DealerTrack, Inc., a Delaware corporation, with its principal place of business at 1111 Marcus Avenue, Lake Success, NY 11042 (“Licensee”).

Each problem is assigned a priority that is mutually agreed between the client and the CMSI team. Priority A issues are addressed immediately. Priority B and C issues are addressed during normal business hours. Service Level Agreement Revised June 29, 2010 Credit Management Solutions, Inc. Confidential and Proprietary 4 Priority A A support request is classified as a Priority A if the problem has interrupted or impaired the operation of the customer's system. The following criteria should be used as a guideline in determining a Priority A condition: • evaluate not processing any tranactions • evaluate shuts down unexpectedly • evaluate will not start Because of the serious impact problems of this nature have on the customer's operation, they must be handled immediately. The goal for Priority A problems is to either provide a resolution or a mutually agreed-upon workaround as soon as possible after receiving the client’s call. Furthermore, to ensure that Priority A problems are resolved as quickly as possible, the following escalation process will be followed. Escalation Procedures for Priority A Within 15 minutes of the reported problem: The Customer Support Analyst: • Notifies CMSI Management with a brief description of the problem • Logs the problem into the tracking system. • Discusses with the Customer Support Manager the current status of the research and any actions taken or actions planned The Customer Support Manager: • Assigns internal resources as needed. • When 1 hour has elapsed: • The Customer Support Manager: • Updates CMSI Management on the status of the problem. • Modifies plan of action as needed and assigns additional resources if necessary. • Contacts management of the vendors involved in the plan of action, if applicable. • Contacts management within the customer organization to let them know the problem has been escalated, provides updates and explains the plan of action. Until the problem is resolved, phone or email updates will be provided every 4 hours. It is CMSI’s target to resolve Priority A problems within 24 hours or less. CMSI will use commercially reasonable efforts to meet this target. Priority B A support request is classified as Priority B if the problem has impaired the operation of the customer's system and the customer's business is being moderately affected. If one or more of the following criteria are applicable to the customer’s problem, it should be classified as a Priority B condition: • Turnaround time on evaluate request is too long • Rules are causing failure to process Service Level Agreement Credit Management Solutions, inc. 5 Revised June 29, 2010 Confidential and Proprietary Priority C A support request is classified as Priority C if the problem has a minor impact on the functionality of the operation of the customer's system and the customer's business is being slightly affected. • Rules returned incorrect results. Escalation Procedures for Priority B & C Once a problem or issue has been assigned a Priority B or C status, it is handled to completion in essentially the same manner as a Priority A issue, but within a more extended time frame that is mutually agreed between the customer and CMSI. Because of this longer time frame, weekly status reports are required as described below. Customer Support Analyst investigates and resolves the issue within a mutually agreed upon time frame. While the issue remains unresolved, Customer Support Analyst Continues to work on the solution and keeps the Customer Support Manager informed. Escalates to a Business Analyst if it appears to be a coding problem or a configuration problem that cannot be diagnosed. Customer Support Analyst maintains contact with the client at least weekly. While working on the solution to be completed by the agreed-upon due date, Customer Support Analyst updates the issue in the system CMSI uses for issue tracking. At the start of each business week after the initial report is received, Customer Support Analyst prepares a status report that satisfies the following requirements: Provides a brief description of the problem Identifies the report date Describes the resolution plan Provides a status of all resolution activities and tasks Indicates the next planned activity Customer Support Analyst forwards the status report to Customer Support Manager for review. After approval, Customer Support Analyst forwards the status report to the client. Software Development Issues Potential software development issues identified during problem resolution are assigned to Product Management. Product Management is responsible for reviewing the issues, categorizing them as issues or enhancements, and assigning a priority for resolution. Those issues identified as Business Critical, which do not have an agreeable work around, will be assigned for immediate resolution. Other non  Business Critical issues and enhancements will be resolved as part of a normal product release. Weekly meeting are held by management to review the open production issues. Issues are designed to be either patched to the existing system or assigned to a release. Issues identified as ‘patch’ candidates are assigned to available development staff and scheduled for delivery. Service Level Agreement Revised June 29, 2010 Credit Management Solutions, Inc. Confidential and Proprietary 6 Upgrade Policies and Procedures Policy In order to continually improve the Evaluate software, new enhancements and fixes will be released for reported issues and for requested enhancements. Regularly, these changes are released in new builds (one single deployment package) under the current version. When these builds are released, clients will be notified and expected to test and schedule installation into their production system. Builds are cumulative, meaning each new build’s module contains all the fixes that are included with previous builds. This procedure means you do not have to install an earlier version of the build before you install the latest version. The rollout of each build’s module provides a cumulative rollup of the changes. CMSI will also be creating new releases. At minimum, two releases will be created per year. CMSI will support the current version plus minus two. When a new release is announced, CMSI will provide 12 months support for the previous releases. Support may be extended, if approved by CMSI, to 24 months for those releases if the client feels additional time is needed for testing and deployment. CMSI will notify the customer and outline the support timelines for a previous release. CMSI strongly recommends that customers evaluate and install the current builds and releases in a timely manner to make sure the evaluate systems are up to date with the most recent software changes. ProcedurefNew Builds within a release) • When a build is released, an email will go out to all customers notifying them that the new build has been placed in a test environment and is ready for testing by the client. • During testing any issues found should be reported to the CMSI support center. Issues will be fixed and a new build will be created and released when available. • After certification of the build, the customer can notify support and schedule the production installation Procedure New Releases • When a new release is announced, a new bulletin will be sent outlining all the new features and fixes that are included. • All releases will not be immediately available to all clients. All features may not be available immediately as it may require configuration. • Any configuration that is needed in order to take advantage of the new functionality will be billed on a time and materials basis. • Client may notify CMSI to request an upgrade so it may be schedule accordingly. • Clients will be notified when a release is ready for testing in their environment. • During testing any issues found should be reported to the Release Upgrade Project team . • After certification of the release, the customer will work with the Upgrade project team to schedule the production installation. • Full upgrades are scheduled over a weekend period.

(“Connexions”) and FIDELITY INFORMATION SERVICES, LLC (“FIS”). This SOW is issued under the Master Services Agreement between Connexions and FIS effective as of October 6, 2017 (the “Agreement”). The terms and conditions of the Agreement are incorporated by this reference. Each capitalized term used herein but not defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in the Agreement. In the event of conflict among any of the provisions set forth in the Agreement and this SOW, the terms in the Agreement shall prevail except as to provisions specifically set forth in writing in this SOW. Any such modifications or amendments in this SOW shall control for purposes of this SOW only. In consideration of the mutual covenants and promises contained herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged by each party, each party agrees as follows: 1. General Services, (a) Connexions will provide travel redemption\/purchase services for all of FIS’ loyalty reward programs for which FIS is the system of record and\/or the fulfillment provider (collectively, the “Programs”). Travel redemption\/purchase services excludes the provision of travel vouchers\/discounts\/gift cards (such as a paper voucher for $100 off a car rental and a $50 gift card for an airline) or any other travel service requested by FIS that Connexions is unable or unwilling to provide or support. Connexions shall fulfill travel redemptions\/purchases for eligible end users of the Programs (“Customers”). Connexions will not market any products and services other than the Program products to Customers without FIS’ written consent. For clarity, marketing by Connexions to a Customer who is also a member of a third party rewards program serviced by Connexions as part of the third party’s rewards program does not violate this provision. Connexions will ensure that its Services comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including, without limitation, U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT’) requirements. (b) Unless delayed by circumstances other than its failure to meet its obligations under the Agreement and\/or this SOW, FIS shall migrate approximately 20% of the total travel redemption\/purchase portion of FIS Programs volume on or before March 18, 2018 and FIS shall migrate the remainder of FIS’ existing Programs to Connexions on or before December 31, 2018 (the “Exclusivity Date”). Both parties will make reasonable commercial efforts to expedite the migration schedule. At the time of migration, FIS will provide Connexions the FIS Rewards parameter file that lists all reward programs that include travel offering support at the time and listing of programs that are pointing the travel page offering to Connexions as objective demonstration of meeting the migration commitment. FIS and Connexions shall work together to determine an orderly migration schedule for 2018. 2. Program Websites, (a) Connexions will develop, host and maintain the online experience (the “Travel Website”), for the Programs in English and United States Dollars, for the redemption\/purchase process, in accordance with the mutually agreed upon FIS Travel Launch Business Requirements Document, version 2.3, dated April 25, 2017 (the “BRD”), Connexions shall create a master Travel Website that will be replicated for each Program requiring a custom branded website, using the logo, colors and headers applicable to each Program. At FIS’ request, Connexions can provide additional customization or functionality and modify the Program rules at the fees specified in the attached Exhibit A. At FIS’ request, Connexions currently can configure a website in the language and currencies indicated on Exhibit B. Connexions and FIS will agree in advance to the effort required and estimated cost for any customization or functionality prior to Connexions making any changes. 1 (b) At a minimum, the travel Website will (i) be mobile responsive and ADA compliant, (ii) be integrated with FIS’ proprietary rewards platform, (iii) retrieve Customer points balances and display relevant Customer details, (iv) support all Payment Types, (v) support presentation of the purchase price on the Travel Website for split pay, which is configurable at the Program level, with a slider bar format or an input box, (iv) be configurable on the Program ID\/client (BIN) level, (vii) support multiple redemption reward structures, including dynamic pricing models (where prices are converted into points), fixed ticket models (where travel items within a specified range cost a fixed amount of points) and dollars off awards (where a specified amount of points equates to a fixed dollar amount off the price), (viii) round point redemptions to the nearest 2500 points, (ix) be accessed via single sign on (SSO) technology from FIS’ website, and (x) will include the fraud monitoring tools described in Exhibit A. As used herein, “Payment Types” means the three ways a Customer can purchase their travel: (i) Redemption: All points are used to redeem the booking; (ii) Full Purchase: A payment card is used to purchase the entire booking; and (iii) Split Tender: A combination of points and a payment card is used to complete the booking. (c) Connexions will add the enhancements listed on the attached Exhibit C to the Travel Website at no cost to FIS. Connexions is committed to ensuring the Customer experience on the Travel Website is not stagnant and continues to evolve. Connexions will host a two day “innovation summit” for FIS during each year of the Term during which the parties will review innovations in the marketplace. The summit will focus on increasing Customer retention, increasing net margins, increasing transactional engagement and reducing transactional friction in the customer’s online experience. (d) (i) FIS will, through Connexions escalation contacts, advise Connexions of all scheduled maintenance and\/or unplanned outages on FIS’s telecommunications network that are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any manner the ability for customers to reach the Travel websites and potentially drive additional calls into the call centers. (ii) Connexions will occasionally need to take the Travel Websites out of operation for Regular Maintenance and Emergency Maintenance. (x) “Regular Maintenance” means any planned maintenance on the Travel Website to implement platform upgrades, patches and\/or fixes and other modifications, which may include new features to Connexions’ existing booking tool or modifications custom to the Travel Website for up to a 6 hour window which is currently between the hours 11:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. Eastern Time, commencing on Saturday night and concluding by Sunday morning at 7:00 a.m. Connexions will publish the calendar for Regular Maintenance at the beginning of each calendar year during the Term and the Regular Maintenance windows will be based on the published monthly release schedule. Connexions will notify FIS in writing (which may be by email) at least 48 hours prior to any Regular Maintenance indicating the planned time and duration of planned activities that pertain to FIS and Regular Maintenance will be followed by a post-maintenance report within 2 business days detailing the results where relevant to FIS. (y) “Emergency Maintenance” means any maintenance for the Travel Website that must be performed promptly, outside of the Regular Maintenance window due to potential impacts to servicing, although Connexions will use commercially reasonable business efforts to conduct emergency maintenance between the hours of 1:00 a.m. and 7:00 a.m. Eastern Time. Written notice (including via email) of Emergency Maintenance shall be given to FIS as soon as reasonably possible upon the need being identified. Emergency Maintenance activity will be followed by a post-outage report within 1 business day after the release detailing the accomplishments. 3. Rewards Options and Display on Travel Website. 2 (a) Customers will be able to book air, hotel, car, activities, cruise, tour and insurance through Connexions (“Travel Components”). Additional Travel Components may be added or removed as agreed to by Connexions and FIS from time to time. FIS acknowledges that some Travel Components may be bookable only on the Travel Website, other reward options may be bookable only in the call center, and some reward options may be bookable on the Travel Website and in the call center. Additionally, FIS acknowledges that insurance is only bookable for the Full Purchase Payment Type, and not for Redemptions or Split Tender. (b) Connexions will source and manage the Travel Components provided for redemption\/purchase through each Program, including informing Customers of terms and conditions related to the selected items. Sourcing and managing the Travel Components includes, without limitation, the following: (i) If an airline offers multiple fare options for seats on the same flight, (examples of fare options include Basic Economy, Coach, Business Class and First Class) Connexions will offer Customers the fare options that Connexions receives from the global distribution system (“GPS”) that it uses for the FIS Travel Components. For airline travel, the Customer (or agent) will be able to view live seat maps in the booking process for over 70 airlines. If those airlines allow for it through the GDS used by Connexions, for the class of service selected by the Customer, Connexions will allow the Customer to select their seat when booking a flight. Where unavailable, the Customer will need to go to the airline’s website to select seats after checkout, if permitted by the class of service selected by the Customer. (ii) Southwest Airlines currently permits Connexions agents to book flights offline only. So long as Southwest Airlines continues to permit Connexions to book flights offline, Connexions will make Southwest Airlines tickets available to Customers for offline booking. (iii) Connexions receives hotel content from multiple providers. Connexions’ technology reviews the hotel content at the property and hotel room level and provided the information is recognized by the technology, the lowest price received by Connexions from its providers will be shown in the booking tool and the higher prices will be suppressed. From time to time Connexions may suppress hotels, whether by individual property, chain or supplier based on its due diligence which may include industry press reports, lack of cooperation to resolve concerns or negative Customer experiences. Connexions will give FIS prompt notice, but in no event greater than twenty- four (24) hours, of any property suppressions across all sourced hotel vendors. (iv) Connexions will include Trip Advisor ratings for hotels on the Travel Website so long as Trip Advisor has reviews for the hotel and Connexions continues to obtain ratings from Trip Advisor. The current functionality displays the 5 most recent reviews. If Connexions no longer obtains ratings from Trip Advisor, Connexions will use commercially reasonable efforts to include traveler ratings from another reputable company within a reasonable time after loss of Trip Advisor. (v) Connexions will offer Customers the ability to display hotels and car results within a map in the Travel Website user interface and to switch back and forth between the map view and the list review of results. Connexions currently uses Google Maps technology to show the results on a map and will offer this functionality so long as Connexions continues to obtain the information from Google Maps. If Connexions no longer obtains maps from Google Maps, Connexions will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide maps from another reputable company within a reasonable time after loss of Google Maps. (vi) Connexions will make one-way car rentals available to Customers, meaning a Customer can pick up the car at one location and return it to another location (one-way rentals). 3 (vii) Connexions will proactively solicit promotions from travel suppliers on a monthly basis for FIS to include in its Customer communications to drive travel volume. 4. Travel Component Cost to Customers. Connexions will utilize a combination of in-house and third party due diligence and proprietary tools to dynamically adjust the cost of travel items to Customers in accordance with the market rate as available on a publicly available online travel agency (“OTA”) website as well as FIS’ requests for additional markup (“FIS Initiated Markup”), Prior to the launch of the Program, Connexions and FIS will set the initial FIS Initiated Markups. Connexions will monitor performance against forecasts during the first 30 days and will make adjustments as needed so long as FIS is in agreement. Connexions and FIS will establish a mutually agreeable cadence to review the pricing and booking results during the first 30-60-90 days of this SOW and Connexions will make agreed upon adjustments to the pricing. Thereafter, FIS and Connexions will have discussions at a minimum of once a month to review booking and markup performance to determine whether the pricing strategy needs to be adjusted. The final FIS Initiated Markup for each Travel Component (as percentage (%) or dollar amount ($)) will be dictated by FIS based on best practices and collaboration between FIS and Connexions. The FIS Initiated Markup will be added to the cost of the Travel Component prior to the price being displayed to the Customer, so that the price displayed to the Customer is inclusive of the FIS Initiated Markup. Connexions shall report the FIS Initiated Markup on Customer bookings on a weekly basis, and shall issue FIS a credit for the FIS Initiated Markup on billing invoices for the Travel Components. 5. Call Center, (a) Connexions shall provide offline customer support, in English, for rewards related requests involving booking a travel item and post-booking servicing accessible by toll-free telephone lines. For the initial migration of 20% of the redemption\/purchase volume of the Programs, the support will be provided from an onshore location using a shared call center environment. When the remaining 80% of the redemption\/purchase volume from the Programs migrates to Connexions, the support will be provided from either an offshore location using dedicated call center agents or from an onshore location using a shared call center environment. Once the migration schedule is established the parties will use commercially reasonable efforts to agree upon an appropriate notice period for the election of the call center environment. FIS may change its selection during the Term, provided that (i) FIS uses its initially selected location for twelve months from the time of 100% migration, (ii) FIS gives Connexions at least 150 days' notice, and (iii) FIS pays the costs to move the call center which costs include items such as severance payments for agents that cannot be reassigned, and the hiring and training costs of new agents. Connexions shall provide FIS with an estimate of the costs prior to incurring the same. If FIS requests that Connexions utilize onshore call center agents in a dedicated environment, the parties will agree in good faith on the incremental costs to FIS to provide a dedicated environment. Call Center Support (frontline and helpdesk) shall be provided from 8:00 AM to Midnight Monday through Friday and 9:00 AM to 9 PM Saturday and Sunday, eastern time, Cruise and Tour hours are Monday - Friday 9:00 AM to 9:00 PM, Saturday 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, eastern time, except for stated holidays (New Year’s Day, U.S. Independence Day, U.S. Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day). After hours Emergency Service is available post-booking. Connexions shall provide dedicated reporting for call center Service Level Agreements identified in Exhibit D, Section C and the reports identified in Exhibit D, Section E if FIS selects the dedicated environment; otherwise Service Level Agreements, and the call center reports are reported based on the shared call center. (b) Connexions will deliver its standard four week classroom training program for all new call center agents and will provide two weeks of nesting at the conclusion of the classroom training. Connexions will work with FIS to incorporate FIS program specific information as warranted into the training program. 4 (c) Connexions shall record all travel calls received and shall retain the recordings in the call recording system for 180 days. Recorded calls shall be archived after 180 days and maintained for an additional 180 days. Currently, after 1 year from the recording calls are deleted. Connexions will provide FIS with remote monitoring access\/capability to both live and pre-recorded call center agent calls with Customers. It takes Connexions up to 2 business days to access recorded calls when they are within the call recording system and up to 7 business days to access recorded calls after they are archived and before they are deleted. Additionally, Connexions and FIS will conduct at least monthly or an otherwise agreed upon schedule between two teams joint call review sessions. Joint sessions can be facilitated between Connexions and FIS and\/or between Connexions and FIS\/FIS’ client at the same time. (d) Connexions prepares rolling call center volume forecasts. FIS shall meet with Connexions (which may be by phone and email) to review the call volume forecast in a 30-60-90 day forward looking manner and provide input based on marketing plans and Program changes. Forecasts will be locked three calendar months in advance of the service month (i.e. the forecast for April will be locked on January 1) for call center staffing and Service Level compliance purposes. (e) If FIS requires copies of or destruction of call recordings and\/or email confirmations upon the termination or expiration of this SOW, FIS shall be responsible for the costs incurred by Connexions to comply with FIS’ request. Such costs include any out of pocket costs to retrieve records from storage systems and\/or to search for and destroy information in a storage system as well as an hourly rate for Connexions in-house resources. 6. Voice Response Unit. In accordance with Connexions’ security standards, Connexions shall program its Voice Response Unite (“VRU”) to request Customers to enter their 16 digit account number (which will appear to the call center agent as a unique ID) or other agreed upon customer identifier into the VRU, enabling the call center agents to access relevant Customer information. 7. Customer Surveys. Connexions will administer a customer service survey for use in connection with online bookings. Customers will receive an online survey via email within an agreed upon number of days of booking. FIS shall have the right to approve the survey in advance of its use and will work collaboratively with Connexions on any updates to the survey content and timeframe it will be used, if at all, and for which FIS clients. Connexions may not publish, except for internal report purposes the results of any customer service survey, which shall be FIS’s Confidential Information. 8. Points Bank Access. Connexions will have access to FIS’s proprietary rewards platform system so that Connexions can access FIS’ points bank for relevant Customer information as needed. 9. Ticket Delivery. All airline tickets are issued as e-tickets. Connexions will send Customers booking confirmations, itineraries and receipts by e-mail if Customer provides an email address. Connexions will also send by U.S. regular mail or facsimile if the Customer docs not have an email address. 10. Travel Itineraries (Confirmation Emails). Each FIS client will be able to customize the verbiage and some of the other elements of the email itineraries sent by Connexions to the Customer after each booking. The itineraries (confirmation emails) can be customized by program ID in order to display details that are relevant to the client’s program. 11. Fraud Monitoring. Connexions will utilize proprietary in-house technology and processes to review each transaction, using the data elements provided, and will evaluate the fraud risk based on a robust and evolving dynamic ruleset and set of processes. The solution utilizes a customizable fraud risk model, confirmed fraudulent blacklist data, evaluation of multiple data components leveraging rules and Artificial Intelligence predictive functionality to proactively identify fraud. Connexions will manually 5 review and investigate transactions that meet certain criteria prior to completion of booking. Based on the review, Connexions will either release the quarantined order for completion or will cancel the order if it is deemed to be fraudulent. Connexions will bear the liability for all fraudulent transactions that are processed. Connexions will monitor fraud trends within FIS Customer bookings and will make modifications to the rules engine as needed. Connexions will provide fraud trend reporting and analysis on a quarterly basis. In addition, FIS will cooperate with Connexions in its efforts to prevent fraud and FIS, to the extent it is permitted to do so, will share information regarding fraudulent activities seen in the other services it provides for the Programs on a regular basis. FIS and Connexions will each notify the other party promptly if it sees an unusual increase in fraudulent activity (the criteria for which shall be agreed to from time to time by the parties) and will share information regarding such activity. Connexions reserves the right, upon notice to FIS, to temporarily stop bookings while it investigates unusual events or increased fraud activities and will work with FIS to identify the cause of the activity and resolve as soon as possible. 12. Personnel. (a) Steering Committee\/Lnitiatives. Each party will assign representatives to an executive steering committee which will meet regularly to set priorities, ensure commitments and timelines are met, and provide governance on direction where needed. The steering committee may meet in person or by phone. In addition, each party will assign resources to execute upon agreed initiatives. (b) Quarterly Business Reviews and Conference Attendance. Connexions commits to four in-person onsite visits with the FIS team during each year of the Term. These visits may take place at FIS locations or Connexions will fund the flight and hotel costs for two FIS resources to travel in person to an agreed upon Connexions office location. Additionally, Connexions is committed to attending one conference jointly with FIS during each year of the Term whereby Connexions will fund the conference registration fee, hotel and air cost for one FIS representative. FIS would be responsible for all other expenses to attend the conference. (c) Designated personnel. Connexions agrees that personnel filling the roles listed below will support the Programs. These personnel are not dedicated resources. i. Account SVP and Account Director will collaborate with FIS and each other, and be accountable to advance Program strategy and performance; ii.

Initially the Account Manager shall reside in either Connexions’ Minnesota or Virginia office to optimize proximity to functional teams (or in any other location where Connexions may relocate its functional teams during the Term). If Connexions desires to assign an Account Manager who works from a location where the Connexions functional teams are not located (whether another office of Connexions’ or its affiliates, or a remote office), Connexions shall obtain approval from FIS first, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld. If FIS wants the Account Manager to reside in a FIS location, the parties will work together in good faith to accomplish this, including agreement on relocation, housing, travel and related expenses if a current Connexions employee relocates to accommodate this request; 6 iii.

Exclusivity. As of the Exclusivity Date, FIS is appointing Connexions as its exclusive provider of travel redemption\/purchase services for all FIS’ Programs. It shall not be deemed a breach of this provision with respect to any current Program that is not converted on or before the Exclusivity Date due to acts of the client that are outside of FIS’ control provided that FIS uses reasonable business efforts to assist such client with the conversion in an expeditious manner and FIS notifies Connexions of any clients who are not able to convert by the Exclusivity Date and keeps Connexions informed on the progress of the conversion timeline. It shall be deemed a violation of this provision if any Program leaves FIS and is converted to a program that is owned or managed by an FIS Affiliate. It shall not be a violation of this provision if FIS or an affiliate acquires a company that has a rewards program that FIS would manage (an “Acquired Program”) and such Acquired Program does not convert to Connexions as the travel provider, however, in the case of an Acquired Program FIS shall use its reasonable business efforts to convert such 8 Acquired Program to the Service. 20.

At FIS’ option for each Program, this fee may be (a) incorporated into the cost of the travel reward in points, dollars or a combination of both, (b) displayed separately as a transaction fee to the consumer (to the extent permitted by law), or (c) this fee may be paid by FIS. Booking fees are assessed per item. Table 2\nComponent Online Offline\nAir $15.00 $25.00\nCar $ 0.00 $ 4.50\nHotel $ 0.00 $ 4.50\nActivity $ 0.00 $ 4.50\nCruise *$20.00 $25.00\nTour (Vacation Package) *$20.00 $25.00\nInsurance $0.00 $ 0.00\n♦Although a fee is indicated for Cruise and Tour online bookings, these cannot currently be booked online and Connexions makes no representations as to whether online bookings for Cruise and Tour will become available. 12 For example, if .1 Customer books two plane tickets and one hotel reservation online, the booking fee would be $30 (($15x2) + 0) and if a Customer books two plane tickets and one hotel reservation via a call center agent, the booking fee would be $54.50 (($25 x 2) + $4.50). (iv) Cancellation\/Changed Booking Fee $20.00\/booking This fee applies per booking and not per item. For example, if a Customer books 2 airline tickets and 1 hotel at the same time and a Customer cancels all three items, there would only be one $20 fee assessed. At FIS’ option for each Program, this fee may be (a) paid directly by the Customer at the time of cancellation\/change, or (b) paid by FIS. (v) Reward Costs: Varies per item The cost of each Travel Component (with the exception of TSA pre-check codes if added as a redemption item) is the total price provided by the inventory and pricing system at the time of purchase\/redemption. Such price includes the mandatory taxes, government fees, and facility charges required to complete the purchase of the Travel Component. Connexions will store the total published airfare cost and the cost of all other Travel Components at the time of reservation in its system with a date stamp. Connexions will provide this data to FIS for reconciliation on or before the 17th of the month following the booking. The cost of TSA pre-check Codes is specified below. (vi) TSA Pre-Check Codes: $85\/Code + fulfillment fees of $1,50\/physical Code or $0.50\/electronic Code fulfilled by Connexions* *If FIS elects to include TSA Pre-Check Codes as a redemption item, the cost is $85\/Code, or the then published price for a Precheck program application (whether the published price is higher or lower). Connexions can fulfill the Codes, or can send the Codes to FIS or FIS’ designated fulfillment provider. The fulfillment fee applies to Codes sent by Connexions to Customers and does not apply to Codes sent by Connexions to FIS or FIS’ designated fulfillment provider. Each Code can be used by the recipient to waive the application fee to apply to the United States Department of Homeland Security Transportation Security Administration’s (TSA) Precheck program. FIS acknowledges that the filing of an application by a recipient does not guarantee acceptance into the TSA Precheck program. Each Code will have an expiration date of at least one (1) year after the date the Code is sent by Connexions to the recipient or to FIS or its fulfillment provider. (vii) Merchant processing fee: 2.5% FIS shall pay Connexions a merchant processing fee on any FIS Initiated Markup where a payment card is used by the Customer as full or partial payment of a booking. For the avoidance of doubt, Connexions will absorb the merchant processing fee on the portion of each payment card transaction up to the FIS Initiated Markup. 100% of merchant fees absorbed by Connexions, up to the FIS Initiated Markup, will be based on the actual travel volume purchased with the payment card, not points. 13 For example purposes only: FIS determines that it wants to add an incremental 5% markup on hotel bookings: Initial price of Travel Component to FIS: $400.00 FIS Initiated Markup (5%): $ 20.00 Total cost to Customer: $420.00 Scenario 1: Customer pays the $420.00 with full points. Merchant fee to FIS = $0.00 Scenario 2: Customer pays the $420.00 with credit card or Split Tender. Merchant fee to FIS = $20.00 x 2.5% = $0.50 (viii) Other IT Development: $135\/hour through December 31, 2020 and $150\/hour thereafter* ♦This fee is for any customization, modifications or enhancements beyond what is included in the initial Business Requirements Document. However, as described in the Section titled “IT Development Fund” in the body of the SOW, Connexions will provide FIS with 1,000 hours of IT development work at no charge during each contract year of the Initial Term. Other IT Development charges will be charged after the 1,000 hours are exhausted. Connexions and FIS would agree in advance to the effort required and estimated cost for any such work. (ix) Marketing Resources: $135\/hour through December 31,2020 and $150\/hour thereafter* ♦This fee does not apply to time spent by Connexions to review\/approve FIS marketing collateral, sourcing Travel Components or promotional content from travel suppliers. This fee would apply to requests by FIS to design and create marketing collateral for FIS. Connexions and FIS would agree in advance to the effort required and estimated cost for any such work. (x) Fraud Monitoring: $waived* 200 hour set up fee (FIS may apply IT Development hours to this or pay hourly) *a. Includes all Payment Types b. Includes an agreed upon reporting period for transactions that fail (weekly) 14 Exhibit B Languages and Currencies currently available 15 EXHIBIT C Travel Website Enhancements 1. Enhancements. Connexions shall add the following enhancements to the Travel Website. A. The following enhancements will be available in a production environment by March 31, 2018: i. Cart Level payment • Ability to apply payment to entire itinerary vs by component ii. Travel wallet • Ability to store preferred credit or debit card in payment flow or Customer profile iii. Taxes and Fees • Ability to show unbundled price for hotels (for easier Customer comparison to online sites that show unbundled prices) iv. Mixed Carriers • Ability to book different airlines for inbound and outbound flights - ability to mix is dependent on airline agreements v. Same Day Bookings • Ability to book components (hotel, car, or activity) on the same day as travel\/use vi. Participant Insights • Enhancement which provides ability to capture details on previous customer searches for online customer engagement, and offline to display for agents for better customer interactions While there will be no cost to FIS to upgrade the Travel Website for these items, if there is a cost from Connexions’ supplier (such as the GDS) to provide the item, Connexions will pass the cost for that item to FIS. Connexions will inform FIS of any costs prior to adding an item with a cost to the Travel Website. B. The following enhancements will be available in a production environment by March 31, 2019: i. Flexible date search ' • Ability to see flight pricing within a specified date range C. Ancillary airline items are currently available through the airlines only and cannot be booked through travel agents, such as checked baggage, priority boarding and assigned premium seats. Connexions is actively monitoring the airline industry for changes to this situation. Connexions’ ability to make any ancillary items available to Customers is dependent on (i) the airline industry making such items available to travel agents generally, and, once available (ii) the ancillary items must be available to Connexions through the global distribution system which Connexions’ uses to book travel. Once ancillary items become available, the timing for availability of each ancillary item may be inconsistent as 16 the airlines are not likely to make all ancillary items available at the same time. Connexions will keep FIS informed of the status of the availability of ancillary items. Once these items are available to Connexions, if FIS wants an item added to the Travel Website, Connexions will work to integrate the ancillary items into its booking process as soon as reasonably practicable. While there will be no cost to FIS to upgrade the Travel Website for these items, if there is a cost from the airlines or the global distribution system to provide the item, Connexions will pass the cost for that item to FIS. Connexions will inform FIS of any costs prior to adding that item to the Travel Website. 2. Delay Penalties. If any enhancement set forth in Section 1 A or B above is delayed beyond the date specified above, Connexions will pay FIS a lump sum penalty of $3,000 per calendar quarter of delay, per enhancement. For example purposes only: if Cart Level Payment is not available until June 15, 2018 and the Taxes and Fees is not available until August 31, 2018, Connexions shall pay FIS a penalty of $9,000 calculated as follows: (a) Cart Level Payment: $3,000 ($3,000 for the three month period April 1-June 30,2018), plus (b) Taxes and Fees: $6,000 ($3,000 for the period April 1-June 30, 2018 and $3,000 for the period July 1, 2018 - September 30, 2018). 17 EXHIBIT D SERVICE LEVEL STANDARDS General Statement on Service Levels Connexions shall perform services in accordance with the service level definitions and standards below (each, a “SL”). Each SL is measured monthly for all Programs in the aggregate. If the call center is in a dedicated environment, SLs are measured on a dedicated basis. If the call center is in a shared environment, SLs are measured on a shared basis. Failure to perform in accordance with the SLs may result in the service credits described in this Exhibit to be provided by Connexions to FIS. The service credits are FIS’ exclusive remedy for Connexions failure to meet a SL. Service credits shall be paid to FIS as an invoice credit. Connexions shall have 120 days from launch of each Program to “ramp up”. SL measurement, and any related service credits, shall not commence until 120 days after the last Program is launched. Root-Cause Analysis - Failure to comply with Service Levels In any month in which Connexions’ fails to meet a SL specified herein (other than incident responses and unless otherwise mutually agreed upon by the parties), Connexions shall have ten (10) business days to: (1) perform a root-cause analysis to identify the cause of such failure; (2) provide FIS with a report detailing the cause of, and procedure for correcting, such failure; and (3) provide an implementation procedure to be performed to cure such service level failure. Although Connexions has ten (10) business days to provide these items, Connexions shall use reasonable business efforts to provide the same within five (5) business days. Compliance Reporting Connexions shall report monthly (by the 17th day of each month) on its level(s) of compliance with each SL during the prior month. Any related service credits due to FIS for SL failures shall be provided by Connexions in the month following the report indicating the SL failure. Service Levels and Service Credits A. Travel Website and Program Availability Program Availability: The percentage of time the Travel Websites and the Programs are available, calculated as follows: the percentage of time equal to (Y-(X-Z))\/Y, where X equals the number of minutes the Travel Websites and the Programs were not available during the month, Y is the total minutes in the month, and Z is the actual minutes during the month that the Travel Websites and the Programs were not available as result of Scheduled Downtime or downtime resulting from a force majeure event. Scheduled Downtime: The actual minutes that the Travel Website is not available in a month due to Emergency Maintenance that is approved by FIS and Regular Maintenance. Travel Website Availability: The percentage of time the Travel Websites are available, calculated as follows: the percentage equal to (Y-(X-Z))\/Y, where X equals the actual minutes the Travel Websites are not available during the month, Y is the total minutes in the month, and Z is the actual minutes of the month that the Travel Websites were not available as result of Scheduled Downtime or downtime resulting from a force majeure event. 18 ♦Travel Website and Program Availability are measured separately and separate service credits apply for any failures.

ARTICLE VIII - CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION Section 8.1. Confidential Information. (a) Scope of Confidential Information. In connection with its performance under this Agreement, each party (a ‘Receiving Party\") may be supplied with materials and information concerning the other party by or on behalf of such other party and\/or its Affiliates (the “Disclosing Party”) which is non-public, confidential or proprietary in nature (the “Confidential Information\") and which may include, but is not limited to, information about or concerning the Disclosing Party’s and\/or its Affiliates’: (i) financial condition and projections; (ii) business ventures and strategic plans; (iii) marketing strategies and programs; (iv) customers and prospective customers and information related to both; (v) strategic insights or statistical models about such customers or prospective customers and their behavior; and (vi) business partners. Confidential Information also includes, but is not limited to: (A) information transmitted in written, oral, magnetic form or any other medium; (B) all copies and reproductions, in whole or in part, of Page 8 of 25 such information; (C) all summaries, analyses, compilations, studies, notes or other records which contain, reflect, or are generated from such information; and (D) the terms of this Agreement and all reports issued under it. Confidential Information does not include information that: (w) has become part of the public domain through no act or omission of the Receiving Party; (x) to Receiving Party’s knowledge after reasonable investigation, was lawfully disclosed to the Receiving Party without restriction on disclosure by a third party (other than on behalf of the Disclosing Party); (y) was developed independently by the Receiving Party; or (z) is or was lawfully and independently provided to the Receiving Party prior to disclosure hereunder from a third party who to the Receiving Party’s knowledge is not and was not subject to an obligation of confidentiality or otherwise prohibited from transmitting such information. (b) Nondisclosure of Information. The Receiving Party agrees that the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party shall be used solely for the purpose of performing its obligations under this Agreement and agrees not to disclose any of the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party now or hereafter received or obtained by it without the Disclosing Party’s prior written consent; provided, however, that the Receiving Party may disclose any such Confidential Information to its Affiliates, representatives, agents, accountants, attorneys and other confidential advisors (collectively, “Advisors”) who need to know the Confidential Information for the purpose of assisting the Receiving Party in performing its obligations under this Agreement or for providing professional advice to the Receiving Party. The Receiving Party agrees to be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by its Advisor, and the Receiving Party agrees that its Advisors will be advised by the Receiving Party of the confidential nature of such information. (c) Ownership of Information. The Receiving Party acknowledges and agrees that any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, in whatever form, is the sole property of the Disclosing Party. The Receiving Party agrees that upon the request of, and as directed by, the Disclosing Party, it shall either return such Confidential Information to the Disclosing Party or shall destroy such Confidential Information, except as may be necessary for the Receiving Party to perform its obligations hereunder. (d) Compelled Disclosure. If the Receiving Party or any of its Advisors is legally compelled by subpoena or order of a court or an agency or other governmental authority of competent jurisdiction to disclose any of the Confidential Information, the Receiving Party shall promptly notify the Disclosing Party in writing of such requirement (unless instructed not to do so by such agency or governmental authority) so that the Disclosing Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and\/or waive compliance with the provisions hereof. The Receiving Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, at the Disclosing Party’s expense, to obtain or assist the Disclosing Party in obtaining any such protective order.

(e) Remedies. The Receiving Party acknowledges that all Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party is considered to be proprietary, may have competitive value and, in many instances, contains trade secrets. The Receiving Party agrees that because of the unique nature of the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, any breach of this Article could cause the Disclosing Party irreparable harm and money damages and other remedies available at law in the event of a breach would not be adequate to compensate the Disclosing Party for any such breach. Accordingly, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled, without the requirement of posting a bond or other security, to seek equitable relief, including, without limitation, injunctive relief and specific performance, as a remedy for any such breach. Such relief shall be Page 9 of 25 in addition to, and not in lieu of, all other remedies available at law or in equity to the Disclosing Party for actual damages caused by the breach.

Section 9.2. Procedures for Indemnification. (a) Notice of Claims. If any claim is made or asserted, or any suit or action is commenced, as to which indemnification may be sought for an Indemnified Party from an Indemnifying Party hereunder (“Claim”), the Indemnified Party shall give written notice (sent by overnight carrier) to the Indemnifying Party, which notice shall contain, in reasonable detail, the facts giving rise to a Claim, as promptly as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than thirty (30) days after the receipt by the Indemnified Party of such notice or knowledge of such Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the omission by the Indemnified Party to give notice hereunder will not relieve the Indemnifying Party from its indemnification obligations except to the extent that such omission results in a failure of actual notice to the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced or damaged as a result of such failure to give notice. (b) Assumption of Defense and Selection of Counsel. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Indemnifying Party has the right to assume the defense of a Claim with respect to which it has received a notice pursuant to Section 9.2(a) and may select counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party Page 10 of 25 in connection with such defense. The Indemnified Party may assume the defense of such Claim if it promptly notifies the Indemnifying Party of its desire to assume the defense of such Claim and the Indemnifying Party consents to such assumption of the defense by the Indemnified Party, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, in which case the Indemnified Party shall have the right to assume the defense and to select counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party at the cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnified Party does not so control the defense of any Claim and the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of such Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not thereafter have the right to employ its own counsel and have the fees and expenses of such counsel paid by the Indemnifying Party, unless (i) the employment of such counsel is authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Party, (ii) the Indemnifying Party has not employed counsel to take charge of the defense of such action within fifteen (15) days after receipt of notice from the Indemnified Party, or (iii) the Indemnified Party has reasonably concluded that there may be defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party (in which case the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of the Indemnified Party), in any of which events such reasonable fees and expenses of the counsel employed by the Indemnified Party shall be borne by the Indemnifying Party. The party defending any Claim shall institute and maintain any such defense diligently and will keep the other parties fully advised of the status thereof. (c) Cooperation. The Indemnified Party shall render to the Indemnifying Party such reasonable assistance as may be requested by the Indemnifying Party (at the expense of the Indemnifying Party ) in order to provide prompt and adequate defense of any Claim hereunder. The Indemnified Party shall make available to the Indemnifying Party and its counsel, accountants and other consultants during normal business hours all books and records of the Indemnified Party relating to any Claim. (d) Settlement of Claims. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend, compromise and settle any Claim in the name of the Indemnified Party to the extent that the Indemnifying Party may be liable to the Indemnified Party hereunder; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not compromise or settle a Claim (i) unless it assumes the obligation to indemnify for all Losses arising out of or relating thereto, (ii) if such settlement or compromise would grant any non-monetary relief, require an admission of wrongdoing by the Indemnified Party or would affect the validity or enforceability of the intellectual property rights of the Indemnified Party, without the consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and (iii) unless there is an unqualified release of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party may not settle or compromise any Claim without the consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If the Indemnified Party settles or compromises any Claim without the consent of the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party’s indemnification obligation shall be void. (e) Indemnification Payments. Amounts owing under this Article shall be paid promptly when due. Section 9.3. (a) Disclaimer of Certain Damages. NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY, ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, SUCCESSORS AND PERMITTED ASSIGNS FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS EVEN IF THEY HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

This document establishes mandatory requirements necessary to: • Ensure that all employees have a clear and consistent understanding of the FIS policies and standards for business travel • Provide business travelers with a reasonable level of service, comfort, safety and security at the optimum cost • Maximize FIS’ ability to negotiate discounted rates with contracted suppliers and reduce travel and related expenses, including the utilization of: o FIS appointed business travel management companies o Corporate credit card programs o Contracted and approved airline, hotel, car rental and rail companies • Ensure that all authorized expenditures meet and comply with country specific regulatory and\/or statutory mandates Statement Travel will be authorized for the following circumstances only: • Client-only travel, which includes work billable to a client and\/or work necessary to: a) fulfill implementation, migration, SLA or other obligations to clients, b) respond to client initiated needs or requests, or c) sales-related travel necessary to pursue new business opportunities • FIS-sponsored events, such as tradeshows and conferences when in alignment with participation guidelines specified by the event sponsor and enforced by the Senior Leadership Team (the “SLT”) business • Request or requirement by governmental or regulatory bodies, legal proceedings or other key external constituents (e.g., investor, industry analysts, media, etc.) If travel is required for purposes other than those listed above, approval by the SLT or a designated delegate is required prior to booking. These type of travel requests will only be approved when business activities cannot be successfully accomplished through conference calls, webinars, video conferencing or other alternatives. Business units may impose greater controls than required by this policy, but never less. An override to this policy will only exist when billable project travel is approved by and will be charged to the client in full. Certain countries may have additional policy requirements because of regulatory or statutory requirements. Booking travel through a company approved travel management company (the “TMC”) or online booking tool (the “OBT”) benefits FIS directly, as greater volumes generate larger discount rates for air, hotel and rental cars. Reservations made through a company approved TMC or OBT also provide FIS visibility to your itinerary should a travel related emergency arise. FIS Internal Use Only Page 5 of 18 Published Date August 16, 2018 DocuSign Envelope ID: 25CBC7F9-E170-42CA-B09A-E20B5FC8600D Personal travel may not be booked through the TMC or OBT. FIS assumes no obligation to reimburse employees for expenses that are not in compliance with this policy, are excessive and\/or erroneous in nature. This includes corporate credit card and\/or out-of-pocket purchases made for non-travel related goods and services detailed in the Corporate Credit Card Standard of this policy. Compliance with this policy will be monitored and exceptions reported to Executive Leadership Team (the “ELT”) and SLT. Repeat policy violations and\/or fraudulent activity will result in loss of travel and corporate credit card privileges and\/or possible termination. FIS managers and executives who have employees who travel or entertain in the normal course of company business have primary responsibility and authority for supporting and ensuring compliance with this policy. Managers are expected to educate and guide employees to ensure expenses submitted for approval are legitimate, reasonable, timely and compliant with the policy. Disciplinary action, up to and including termination, may be taken against a manager, who should have known about a violation by employees under his\/her supervision or did not act promptly to report and correct a violation. The Corporate Travel department has responsibility for interpreting provisions of the policy. 09.01.01 Traveler Profile A “Traveler Profile” is required before making travel arrangements through an OBT, where applicable or a TMC. Data such as frequent traveler programs, seat preferences, corporate credit card and emergency contact information are securely stored, eliminating the need to re-enter information each time you make a reservation. 09.01.02 Travel Arrangements FIS has designated TMC’s and OBT’s that exclusively handle or allow self-service travel booking including airline, hotel and car rental. Booking reservations using the applicable and appropriate agency is mandatory. Travel booked directly with the carrier, either by direct contact or via the internet through any other suppliers such as Expedia, Orbitz, Priceline, etc. will not be reimbursed. Basic, single destination trips should be booked via the OBT where applicable. Employees should call the TMC for more complex trips with multi-destinations, mixed booking classes, etc. to ensure accuracy and cost efficiency. For employee convenience, a travel itinerary will be provided by the TMC via e-mail. If after-hour emergency travel arrangements are required, contact the phone number on your itinerary. 09.01.02.01 Non-Employee Travel A non-employee is defined as, but not limited to, interviewees, speakers or contractors. When possible, all non-employee travel paid for by FIS should be booked through an FIS TMC to ensure the lowest travel expenses. The travel agent may ask you for information including the following: reason for travel, who will be paying for the travel, traveler’s name and contact information, email address, destination of travel, air, hotel, and car details. 09.01.02.02 Travel to High Risk Areas Business travel to certain countries is comprehensively prohibited while other countries are subject to restrictions including preapprovals. See the Country Risk Policy for additional information. International SOS FIS has partnered with International SOS (the “ISOS”) to keep our global workforce healthy, safe, and secure. FIS currently captures travel data from many global TMC’s for our risk and security teams. If you are in a region that does not FIS Internal Use Only Page 6 of 18 Published Date August 16, 2018 DocuSign Envelope ID: 25CBC7F9-E170-42CA-B09A-E20B5FC8600D have a dedicated TMC, you are required to create a travel profile in ISOS and ensure trip details are recorded. Details can either be added manually or by forwarding travel itineraries to ISOS. Please visit FIS & Me for further guidance on this process and www.internationalsos.com for more details on how the ISOS program works. FIS Membership Number for ISOS: 11BYCA092933 09.01.02.03 Continuity of Operations To guard against the consequences of a common disaster and to safeguard the continuity of FIS operations, travel by employees on the same airplane, automobile, train or other common carrier is restricted to a limit of ten FIS employees from the same cost center. The FIS designated TMC will monitor this activity and offer alternative travel information, if applicable. 09.01.02.04 Travel Fees FIS incurs transaction fees for all tickets generated through the FIS designated TMC. These fees are lower if booked via an OBT; therefore, utilizing OBT’s where available for basic single destination trips is more cost effective. All elements of your trip, such as airfare, hotel and car rentals should be included within one booking transaction whenever possible to reduce additional booking fees. 09.01.03 Air Transportation FIS has leveraged its air travel spend and strategically aligned itself with airline partners offering a valuable combination of extensive air route systems and competitive pricing. The preferred air carriers must be used where available and if offering the lowest airfare. Business travel by FIS employees is restricted to corporate and commercial aircraft. The use of private aircraft for business purposes is not allowed for any travel purposes, including client; costs will not be reimbursed. FIS’ standard baggage allowance is one checked bag (if required), unless traveling more than seven days or if it is necessary to transport approved company property. 09.01.03.01 Class of Service All travel segments will be booked at the lowest fare. A segment is defined as one takeoff and one landing. FIS travelers will adhere to the following class of service requirements: • Travel segments less than or equal to 5 hours will be booked in economy class • Travel segments greater than 5 hours may be booked in premium economy\/economy comfort or the equivalent if the option is available on your route • Travel segments greater than 10 hours may be booked in business class, unless your manager places further budgetary restrictions on your travel • Multiple Stop\/Destination Trips: If you have a business trip which includes multiple destinations and\/or flight segments each segment should be booked in the relevant booking cabin class as per the guidelines above. A combined ticket booked in the same cabin class is permitted if this does not incur any additional cost to the company. Employees should contact the Travel Management Company for more complex trips • First-class travel may not be booked and is not permitted under this policy If the travel is billable, follow the client contract\/SOW regards to class of service. FIS approved travel arrangements, while on route, may not be changed for personal convenience if the result is an increase in the cost to FIS. FIS Internal Use Only Page 7 of 18 Published Date August 16, 2018 DocuSign Envelope ID: 25CBC7F9-E170-42CA-B09A-E20B5FC8600D The SLT or designated delegate can also approve the Class of Service deviations at their discretion. 09.01.03.02 Advance Purchase Fares Airline reservations and purchases must be made at least 14 days in advance, securing the best rate possible. Exceptions to the advance purchase fares will be permitted if approved by the SLT or designated delegate and must be client related, regulatory or necessary to meet with key constituents as noted in the statement of this policy. 09.01.03.03 Non-refundable Fares\/Refunds Using the lowest restricted, non-refundable fare is required. Although these types of fares may incur penalties if changed or cancelled, FIS achieves substantial savings versus the purchasing of refundable tickets. The employee and his\/her manager should have a clear understanding of the restrictions, penalties and financial implications prior to altering travel plans. Cancellations should be reported to the TMC or applicable booking agency to ensure all respective travel services are also cancelled and the applicable refunds are requested and processed. The employee must ensure that refunds are properly accounted for on an expense report. Company paid refunds cannot be used for personal use. 09.01.03.04 Frequent Traveler Programs Employees are entitled to keep mileage or other benefits earned under any frequent traveler program to which they belong. Participation in these programs must not influence flight, hotel, car or train\/rail selections that would result in incremental cost to FIS. 09.01.03.05 Airline Related Fees Employees will not be reimbursed for the following types of airfare fees: • Seat upgrades • Purchase of additional frequent flier miles • Airport lounge access • Airline club memberships Reimbursement will be allowed for the following airfare fees: • Southwest Airlines early bird check-in fees • The cost for a standard seat allocation if no free seat assignment is included with your airline\/carrier • Standard seat upgrades for travelers with medical conditions or disabilities, pursuant the People Office guidelines 09.01.04 Car Rental Employees must use a preferred car rental supplier when renting a vehicle for company business. To minimize the number of rental cars required, employees should coordinate with others traveling to the same destination whenever the opportunity arises. 09.01.04.01 Class of Rental Cars FIS authorizes the use of intermediate (mid-size) cars. Justification should be clearly indicated on the expense report, if an alternate class is required for one of the following reasons: • Full-size rentals and minivans are allowed when transporting three or more individuals FIS Internal Use Only Page 8 of 18 Published Date August 16, 2018 DocuSign Envelope ID: 25CBC7F9-E170-42CA-B09A-E20B5FC8600D • Minivans or larger vehicles are allowed for transporting equipment that would otherwise not fit into intermediate vehicles • Upgrades are allowed when the rate is the same or lower than the intermediate rate 09.01.04.02 Rental Car Procedures FIS employees should ensure liability and collision insurance is included through the rental car agency. When renting a car within the US, regardless of origin, FIS has liability and collision included with contracts with Avis, Hertz and Enterprise car rental agencies. Therefore, when utilizing Avis, Hertz and Enterprise in the U.S., employees should always decline insurance when renting a vehicle. If additional coverage is elected, it is at the employee’s expense. However, if one of those three rental agencies is not being used, the employee is required to take liability and collision insurance. When renting a car within Canada, regardless of origin, FIS has liability and collision included in contracts with Avis and Hertz. The cost of a rental car will not be reimbursed for weekend or holiday travel unless the car is required and used for company business during that time. Employees must obey all applicable state and federal laws and traffic regulations worldwide. If an employee driving a rental vehicle is involved in an accident as a result of, or is cited for, driving while legally intoxicated, under the influence of narcotics, driving recklessly, or willfully disobeying traffic laws, the employee may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination. Fines for parking and\/or any moving violations are not reimbursable. 09.01.04.03 Business Related Auto Claims In the event of an accident, promptly take the following steps: • If possible, move the vehicle to a safe location out of the way of traffic. Call for medical attention if anyone is hurt • Secure the names and addresses of drivers and occupants of any vehicles involved, their operator's license numbers, insurance company names and policy numbers, as well as the names and addresses of injured persons and witnesses. Do not discuss who is at fault or sign anything for anyone except an authorized representative of Fidelity National Information Services, LLC, a police officer, or a representative of Sedgwick CMS (our claims adjusting company) • Immediately notify your supervisor and email Insurance@fisglobal.com • If you are in your personal vehicle on company business, follow the instructions you received for accident reporting from your personal insurance company o In the event of an accident with a personal vehicle for FIS business, the employee and employee’s insurance company are responsible for damages to the employee’s car. Please refer to the employee handbook “Use of Vehicles for Company Business” section for more information o If you are in a rental car on company business, follow the instructions included in your service contract for accident reporting o When there is theft of or damage to your vehicle only, and you did not witness the damage to the vehicle, you must notify the local police department immediately. Follow claim reporting instructions above. Please visit FIS and Me for more information. 09.01.04.04 Rental Car Fees Employees will not be reimbursed for the following types of fees: • Paid upgrades FIS Internal Use Only Page 9 of 18 Published Date August 16, 2018 DocuSign Envelope ID: 25CBC7F9-E170-42CA-B09A-E20B5FC8600D • Satellite radio 09.01.04.05 Rental Car Refueling Fuel charges are reimbursable if rental cars are returned with a full tank of gas. The traveler should not accept the fueling option provided by the rental car company. 09.01.05 Other Ground Transportation Travel by Personal Automobile Generally, a rental car must be used if traveling more than 400 miles in total. Travelers should evaluate whether a rental car is more economical than other means of transportation, such as air travel, personal vehicle\/mileage reimbursement or rail options. 09.01.05.01 Rail Travel Rail travel service is permitted if it is the most economical means of travel. Where available rail travel should be booked in advance via the OBT or dedicated company rail booking URL. If not, available rail travel can be made direct with the rail carrier\/station. Employees are responsible for cancelling rail reservations via the original booking source and should ensure all applicable refunds are received and processed in an expense report. All rail travel should be standard class at the lowest possible fare bar any regional approved exceptions. Upgrades will not be reimbursed. 09.01.05.02 Travel by Personal Automobile Generally, a rental car must be used if traveling more than 400 miles in total. Travelers should evaluate whether a rental car is more economical than other means of transportation, such as air travel, personal vehicle or rail options. 09.01.05.03 Transportation to\/from the Airport Whenever possible, employees should utilize the lowest cost of transportation service to\/from the airport. Airport and hotel shuttle bus service is usually more cost effective than a taxi and should be used whenever feasible. Taxis can be used when time constraints justify or regular airport transportation is not an option. These forms of transportation should be shared by employees whenever possible. Travel by personal car is permitted. Employees who commute to work daily using a personal car and travel to\/from the airport in their personal car for business trips can be reimbursed for the difference between the mileage of a normal daily commute from home to work and the commute from home to the airport. 09.01.05.04 Airport Parking Employees must use the most economical option for airport parking. Economy or an “off-airport” lot is typically less expensive. 09.01.05.05 Toll Charges Necessary toll charges are reimbursable under this policy. 09.01.06 Lodging Employees required to stay overnight on authorized business are required to select a preferred FIS hotel within close vicinity of the business or client visited. Membership to a frequent guest program should not influence selection if the result is an increase in the cost to FIS. 09.01.06.01 Preferred Hotels FIS Internal Use Only Page 10 of 18 Published Date August 16, 2018 DocuSign Envelope ID: 25CBC7F9-E170-42CA-B09A-E20B5FC8600D FIS has negotiated preferred rates at hotels worldwide. Employees must use the FIS preferred hotels and book through an FIS designated TMC and\/or OBT, whenever possible. Please visit FIS and Me for a list of preferred hotels. If there are issues finding a preferred hotel where you may be traveling, it is acceptable to: • Select a local TMC negotiated hotel or suitable hotel within the policy guidelines • Contact a designated TMC for assistance booking alternative accommodations Both methods will record your reservation and ensure your trip is tracked for compliance and safety purposes. Exceptions for booking hotel accommodations through a designated TMC or OBT include, but are not limited to: • Conferences or other events where accommodations were pre-arranged • Stay with friends or family • Client booked hotel • An approved TMC is not available in your region • Travel destination is in a remote location where no travel industry represented hotels are available • Extended stays 09.01.06.02 Extended Stay \/Temporary An extended stay or temporary assignment is defined as 4 or more weeks away from the employee’s regular place of business, at the request of FIS, for purposes of carrying out company-related activities. Please contact your Human Resources representative for additional details. 09.01.06.03 Guaranteed Arrival\/No-Show Fees Employees must cancel reservations by the specified cancelation policy of the hotel to avoid no-show charges. Early check-out fees may apply for departure prior to original check-out date, therefore please plan accordingly. Consideration should be made when choosing pre-paid, non-refundable hotel rates in order to avoid any financial implications if changed or cancelled. Pre-paid, non-refundable hotel rates while traveling on business are not recommended. If your current booking method allows you to choose restricted hotel rates, please seek approval from your manager (to consider cost saving versus possible financial risk should your trip be changed or cancelled), before booking. 09.01.06.04 Suite\/Executive Floor Use It is FIS’ standard that no additional costs will be incurred by the company involving suite\/executive floor use. 09.01.06.05 Combined Business\/Personal Travel It is the employee’s responsibility to obtain rates\/costs from a designated TMC when combining business and personal travel. The employee must deduct any personal charges from the total cost of the business trip. If combined with business, employees must have management approval prior to the trip. If vacation and\/or personal days are included within the trip, all related costs must be at the employee’s expense. 09.01.07 Laundry\/Dry Cleaning The reasonable actual costs of such services are allowable when travel exceeds seven days. In addition, only items laundered during the trip will be reimbursed. Laundry completed in anticipation of a trip or after the employee returns does not apply. FIS Internal Use Only Page 11 of 18 Published Date August 16, 2018 DocuSign Envelope ID: 25CBC7F9-E170-42CA-B09A-E20B5FC8600D 09.01.08 International Health Screenings To help ensure the well-being of FIS employees when traveling, in rare cases, a pre-travel medical health screening assessment may be helpful. The CDC website provides more information regarding medical requirements for high risk countries. If necessary, obtain applicable shots from your doctor or the local health department, and submit an expense report for reimbursement. 09.01.09 Immigration Requirements All employees who travel for FIS internationally, must ensure that they are compliant with all immigration legislation. Breaches of immigration compliance will be taken seriously and could result in disciplinary action, in accordance with FIS’ Code of Business Conduct and Ethics Program. Employees must ensure that they have a current passport and a visa\/work authorization (if required) that is suitable for the activities to be performed in the overseas country. It is recommended that an employee has at least 6 months’ validity left on their passport from the date of travel. Processing times to obtain visas and passports can vary greatly based on location and time of year. Employees must obtain the necessary immigration documentation prior to travel to ensure sufficient processing time. Information on estimated processing times and fees for visas by country can be found on FIS & ME. Fees are reimbursable if you are required to obtain a passport\/visa for business travel. 09.01.10 Global Travel and Entertainment Policy-Corporate Credit Card and Expense Reimbursement Standard FIS utilizes American Express© for all applicable business travel including, but not limited to: air, hotel, rental car, entertainment and meals where corporate credit card programs are offered. If you are a permanent employee and a business traveler, FIS encourages you to apply for a corporate credit card. All employees approved for the corporate credit card are required to use the corporate credit card for business travel and in accordance with this standard. 09.01.10.01 Standard Employees traveling with a corporate credit card must use that corporate credit card for all approved and allowable company-related travel and expenses. Using a personal credit card or cash is permitted when: • The FIS corporate credit card is not accepted • Locally, there is a company central billing card (or Business Travel Account\/BTA) in place for specific services, such as air travel, hotel or car rental that has been pre-approved The following purchase and\/or expense types are not allowed via any FIS corporate credit card, personal credit card or cash: • Capital purchases or fixed assets • Cash advances • Club memberships • Computer hardware and software FIS Internal Use Only Page 12 of 18 Published Date August 16, 2018 DocuSign Envelope ID: 25CBC7F9-E170-42CA-B09A-E20B5FC8600D • Drugs\/narcotics, including over the counter medication\/tobacco • Independent contractors • Donations - see the charitable contributions information located on FIS and Me • Office supplies • Furniture and fixtures including carpeting and wall coverings - should be requested through the local Facilities Coordination Center • Hotel no-show cancellation charges (unless company directed) o Exceptions may apply only if: ■ Cancellation was beyond the employee’s control to cancel within the cancellation policy ■ Company directed cancellation o Evidence or substantiation will be required for reimbursement of cancellation • Late fees, penalties • Movies (hotel or in-flight) • Newspapers and\/or non-trade or job specific subscriptions • Personal entertainment • Personal expenses or purchases (including, but not limited to) o Expenses or personal debts o Clothing, food, etc. o Home internet o Home telephone or cellular bills o Personal hygiene related items o Spouse\/Companion and\/or family travel o Valuables misplaced or stolen while traveling • Political Contributions • Remote employee or Telecommuter Expenses o Office equipment o Furniture o Computer hardware and software • Tuition reimbursement - see tuition assistance on FIS and Me • Traffic or parking fines • Transactions made at “adult entertainment” venues o These transactions include, but are not limited to, meals\/beverages at “adult entertainment” venues • Vendor invoices • Wireless devices • Wire transfers or money orders Deliberately failing to adhere to this standard may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination. 09.01.10.02 Employee-incurred Expense and Reimbursement It is the responsibility of the employee incurring business expenses to properly complete and submit an expense report in a timely manner. It is not FIS' responsibility to manage an employee's expense reports. While traveling on company business, every employee is charged with the responsibility of treating the company's funds as his\/her own funds. FIS' goal is to contract expenses at a responsible level while ensuring that we received adequate value for the travel dollars expended. FIS Internal Use Only Page 13 of 18 Published Date August 16, 2018 DocuSign Envelope ID: 25CBC7F9-E170-42CA-B09A-E20B5FC8600D Expense reports must be submitted and approved by management within 30 days of the completion of a business trip or business transaction. Approving managers must log into the respective expense reporting tool or manually approve reimbursement requests after validating transactions are legitimate, reasonable and comply with policy. All late fees, delinquency charges, suspension fees, finance charges and any other fees charged by American Express are the cardholder's responsibility and should not be approved unless the fee is specifically related to a system failure. Employees will be reimbursed for any authorized, actual, and reasonable expenses incurred while conducting company business or while traveling on authorized company business. 09.01.10.03 Misconduct Negligence in reporting and properly substantiating business expenditures or failure to adhere to any other provisions of FIS standard may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination. In addition, the deliberate falsification of expense records, claims or participation in any other fraudulent or deceptive actions may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination as well as the initiation of legal action. Such misconduct is a violation of company standard on the grounds of misconduct as defined in FIS' Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. Dishonesty, misrepresentation of facts or misrepresentation of facts in obtaining employee benefits and privileges, or the falsification of any document or FIS record(s) is prohibited. This includes improper expense reporting, inappropriate use of the corporate credit card, and any other unauthorized activity that is outside of the scope of the FIS Corporate Credit Card Standard. Such actions may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment. Please note that negligence or other serious misconduct on the part of those responsible for approving expense reports and other related documents may also result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment. Adult Entertainment Adult entertainment is not a reimbursable expense. Regardless of whether this might be an accepted business practice in some countries, FIS will not tolerate the use of Company funds at adult entertainment establishments or for adult entertainment provided at some other location. “Adult entertainment” is defined as nightclub type entertainment that includes shows or other activities with an overtly sexual content (e.g. topless bars, strip clubs, etc.). “Adult entertainment” is also defined as any entertainment which, were it reported (with pictures) in a newspaper of general circulation in the local community where any attendee at the event lives, might be seen by a substantial segment of the community to reflect badly upon the Company or the attendees at the function. Use of the FIS Corporate Credit Card or submission of cash receipts for expenditures related to “adult entertainment” (business or personal) is prohibited. 09.01.10.04 Delinquent Accounts FIS reserves the right to deny expense reimbursements that are greater than 30 days old. Timely reconciliation and submission practices are necessary to ensure company expenses are booked and client related costs are billed for the appropriate accounting periods. 09.01.10.05 Suspension Timelines American Express will suspend any credit card account that reaches 90-days past due and will not reinstate until the delinquent balance is paid in full. 09.01.11 Expense Reimbursement FIS Internal Use Only Page 14 of 18 Published Date August 16, 2018 DocuSign Envelope ID: 25CBC7F9-E170-42CA-B09A-E20B5FC8600D Approval Authority Guidelines No employee may act as an authorized approver for his\/her own expense report. The approval of at least one authorized person, usually the employee’s manager, is required before reimbursements will be made against such documents. To minimize the risk of inappropriate approval, employees should avoid booking or charging any travel or non-travel related expenses for his\/her direct line of management (those who would be approving their expense reports). If an employee is required to book travel for his\/her manager, evidence in the form of an email approval from the manager’s manager must be provided with the expense report as evidence of pre-approval for booking on the manager’s behalf. Failure to provide such evidence will result in rejection of the expense report and further investigation of expenses. Required Receipt Documentation Itemized receipt and supporting documentation are critical for expedient audit processing, billing clients for appropriate costs and ensuring compliance. The following receipt criteria will apply: • Itemized receipts for US-based employee travel related expenses greater than or equal to $50 USD, regardless of payment method • Itemized receipts for all non-US based employee travel related expenses, regardless of payment method Documentation requirements may change at the company’s discretion.

This Assignment may be modified or waived, in whole or in part, only by a written document signed by all parties.

Upon the Effective Date, this Assignment shall be binding on the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. The parties each covenant and agree to execute, to acknowledge and to deliver, at their own expense, such other instruments and to take such other actions as may be reasonably required to effectuate this Assignment whenever and so often as reasonably required so to do by the parties hereto, their successors and assigns. Failure by any party to enforce at any time any of the terms and conditions of this Assignment shall not be considered a waiver of that party’s right to enforce such terms and conditions. No waiver by any party of any of its rights under this Assignment shall be valid unless in writing signed by such party, and no waiver of a breach of any provision shall constitute a waiver of any future breach of such provision or a breach of any other provision.

The term \"control\" including the terms \"controlling,\" \"controlled by,\" and \"under common control with\" means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to cause the direction of the management and policies of the Person in question, whether through the ownership of voting shares, by contract or otherwise. References herein to the Disclosing Party and the Receiving Party shall include any Affiliate of such Party that discloses or receives Confidential Information pursuant to this Agreement. Both Parties acknowledge that in the course of their discussions, the Disclosing Party may make available to the Receiving Party certain technical, financial or business information, models, names of actual or potential customers or partners, proposed businesses, reports, plans, facts, market projections, methods of operation, data, analyses, work papers, compilations, comparisons, projections, studies or any other tangible or intangible confidential or proprietary information, prepared or used by Disclosing Party, and\/or certain information and material identified by the Disclosing Party as “Confidential” (hereafter collectively referred to as “Confidential Information”). Confidential Information may be written, oral, visual, recorded, electronic or otherwise fixed in some media. In addition, Confidential Information includes (i) the fact that information has been made available or is being inspected or evaluated by the Receiving Party, (ii) the fact that discussions are taking place between the Parties, and (iii) any information, work papers, analysis, compilations, comparisons, projections, studies, documents, terms, conditions, correspondence, facts or other materials derived or produced by the Receiving Party, including its employees, contractors or agents, in whole or in part, from Confidential Information. THIS MUTUAL NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT (“Agreement”) dated as of June 15^2005, is entered into by and between Credit Union 24, Incorporated, having its principal place of business at 2473 Care Drive, Suite 1, Tallahassee, Florida 32308 (“Credit Union 24”), and Fifth Third Processing Solutions, a division of Fifth Third Bank, an Ohio banking corporation having its principal place of business at 38 Fountain Square Plaza, Cincinnati, Ohio 45263 (“Contractor”). Credit Union 24 and Contractor each are individually referred to herein as the “Party”, or collectively referred to herein as the “Parties”. For the purposes of this Agreement, each Party will be referred to as the “Disclosing Party” where it discloses Confidential Information (as defined below), and as the “Receiving Party” where it receives the other Party’s Confidential Information. WHEREAS, the Parties may make available to each other certain technical or business information deemed confidential during the course of such discussions; and WHEREAS, both Parties are interested in entering into discussions regarding a possible business relationship; and WHEREAS, both Parties may use such confidential information to evaluate a possible business relationship with each other (the “Evaluation”); and WHEREAS, each Party seeks to maintain the confidentiality of such confidential information that it discloses to the other Party. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing recitals, premises and the mutual agreements herein contained, and for other good and valuable consideration (the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged), the Parties hereto agree as follows: 1. Page 1 of 4 3. Both Parties acknowledge that all Confidential Information furnished by the Disclosing Party is considered a trade secret and is a matter of strict confidentiality. Each Party also acknowledges that the unauthorized use or disclosure of any Confidential Information may cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party. Accordingly, the Receiving Party agrees that the Disclosing Party may be entitled to equitable relief, including injunction and specific performance, in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity for any threatened or actual breach of this Agreement. 4. In consideration of the above, the Receiving Party agrees that it will employ the same security measures to Confidential Information received from the Disclosing Party that it would apply to its own comparable confidential information (but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care in handling Confidential Information). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Receiving Party further agrees that it will not distribute, disclose or convey to third parties any Confidential Information, except as specifically provided in this Agreement. 5. The Receiving Party further agrees that: (a) only Receiving Party’s and its Affiliates' employees, contractors or agents with a need to know shall be granted access to Confidential Information and only after they have been informed of the confidential nature of Confidential Information and agreed to maintain the confidentiality of Confidential Information pursuant to terms no less protective of the Disclosing Party’s interests and rights therein as set forth in this Agreement; and (b) it shall not make use of any Confidential Information other than expressly in connection with performing the Evaluation, and shall not use Confidential Information for purposes of competing with the Disclosing Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party acknowledges and agrees that the other Party may be a competitor and that nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict either Party from competing with the other Party in any manner, as long as the Confidential Information of the other Party is not used for such purpose. In the event any third party requests the Receiving Party to submit Confidential Information to such third party pursuant to subpoena, summons, search warrant or the Receiving Party is required to disclose any Confidential Information as a result of any other in a judicial, administrative or governmental proceeding or order, the Receiving Party shall notify the Disclosing Party promptly upon receipt of such request to enable the Disclosing Party to object to such request prior to any release of Confidential Information or waive the Receiving Party's compliance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement. If the Disclosing Party objects to the release of Confidential Information, the Receiving Party shall permit counsel chosen by the Disclosing Party and acceptable to the Receiving Party to represent the Receiving Party in order to resist any release of Confidential Information. The Disclosing Party shall indemnify the Receiving Party for any expenses incurred by the Receiving Party in connection with resisting the release of Confidential Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, as a result of such request or requirement, the Receiving Party is, in the written opinion of its legal counsel compelled to disclose Confidential Information or be held liable for contempt or other penalty before the Disclosing Party has the opportunity to obtain a protective order or to waive the confidentiality provisions of this Agreement, the Receiving Party may disclose such Confidential Information without, liability to the Disclosing Party under this Agreement, provided that the Receiving Party has complied with the notice provisions of this section; and that the Receiving Party shall disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information that its legal counsel advises that it is legally required to disclose. The obligations set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 6 above shall not apply to: (a) Confidential Information: (i) which was publicly available when received or subsequently becomes publicly available through no fault of the Receiving Party; (ii) which was disclosed to the Receiving Party by a third party not under an obligation of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party; (iii) which was independently developed by the Receiving Party not otherwise in violation or breach of this Agreement or any other obligation of the Receiving Party to the Disclosing Party; or (iv) which was rightfully known to the Receiving Party prior to entering into this Agreement; or (b) any disclosure specifically authorized in writing by the Disclosing Party. Page 2 of 4 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. This Agreement is effective upon the date first written above. Either Party may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the other Party, and all confidentiality obligations shall survive in accordance with this Section 10.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligations under this Agreement with respect to Confidential Information consisting of trade secrets shall not expire and shall remain in full force and effect. The Receiving Party agrees that all Confidential Information shall at all times remain the sole property of the Disclosing Party and shall be returned to the Disclosing Party or destroyed as set out in Paragraph 9 immediately upon Disclosing Party's demand. No rights or licenses, express or implied, are granted by the Disclosing Party to the Receiving Party under any patents, copyrights, or trade secrets of the Disclosing Party as a result of or related to this Agreement. If during the Evaluation the Receiving Party determines that it does not wish to proceed with the proposed business relationship, then the Receiving Party (i) shall promptly deliver to the Disclosing Party all documents and other materials comprising Confidential Information, in the possession or under the control of the Receiving Party and its employees, contractors or agents, together with all copies and summaries thereof, and (ii) shall destroy all materials generated or prepared by the Receiving Party and its employees, contractors or agents that include or refer to any part of the Confidential Information, including, without limitation, all analyses, compilations, summaries, studies, notes, machine readable archival copies of Confidential Information and other material without retaining a copy of any such materials. Alternatively, and providing the Disclosing Party provides its prior written consent, the Receiving Party shall destroy all documents and other materials constituting Confidential Information in the possession or under the control of the Receiving Party and its employees, contractors or agents within ten (10) business days after receipt of the Disclosing Party's written consent to such destruction. The Receiving Party agrees that if requested by Disclosing Party, ah authorized officer of the Receiving Party shall certify to the Disclosing Party in writing that all such information and materials have been delivered or destroyed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the delivery or destruction of Confidential Information and related materials required by this Paragraph 9, any and all duties or obligations existing under this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect as provided in Paragraph 10. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to grant the Receiving Party a license to any Confidential Information disclosed or to any patents, trademarks, copyrights or any other intellectual property derived from the Confidential Information disclosed. Neither Party makes any implied or express representations or warranties as to the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information and neither Party shall have any liability to the other resulting from its reliance on or use of the Confidential Information. Each Party further agrees that it is not entitled to rely on the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information. The Parties agree that no failure or delay by either Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof; nor will any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder. This Agreement represents the entire agreement between Credit Union 24 and Contractor concerning the confidentiality of the Confidential Information. No modifications of this Agreement or waiver of the terms and conditions hereof will be binding upon the Parties unless approved in writing by each Party. Page 3 of 4 15. This Agreement shall be binding on the Parties and their successors and assigns, and its provisions may only be waived by written agreement of the Parties. The terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable, and in the event that any term or provision hereof or portion thereof is deemed or held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the remaining terms and provisions hereof and portions thereof shall nevertheless continue and be deemed to be in full force and effect. 16. This Agreement shall be governed by the internal laws of the State of Florida, without regard to conflicts of laws principles. 17. Each of the undersigned individuals represent and warrant that he has the power and authority to enter into this Agreement and bind their respective companies as their authorized representatives. 18.

The Customer shall promptly: 8.1.1. perform all its obligations under this Agreement; 8.1.2. provide Creditcall with all reasonably necessary Customer Materials for Creditcall to perform the Services; and 8.1.3. cooperate with Creditcall to the extent reasonably required by Creditcall in order to enable Creditcall to perform its obligations under this Agreement. 9. 9.1. OWNERSHIP Neither party shall acquire any right, title or interest in or to the IPR owned by or otherwise licensed to the other party (including in respect of the Creditcall Materials and the Customer Materials). For the avoidance of doubt and as between the parties, the Customer shall own the IPR in the Integrated Solution (apart from the Licensed Software).\n9.2. Each party shall do (or procure to be done) all further acts and things and sign (or procure the signature) of all such other documents as the other may from time to time reasonably request for the purpose of giving that party the full benefit of the provisions of this clause 9.2.\n10. 10.1. RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS Subject to clause 10.2 each party agrees that it will not, during the Term and for 12 months from expiration of the Term or termination of this Agreement if sooner (for whatever reason) offer (or procure or facilitate the making of any such offer) employment to, enter into a contract for the services of, or entice away from the other party any Key Employee of that other party.\n10.2. The restrictions in clause 10.1 shall not apply in any situation where: 10.2.1 any Key Employee responds to a general advertisement or voluntarily approaches the other party; or 10.2.2 the contract between a party and their Key Employee is terminated for any reason (including without limitation through dismissal, redundancy or voluntary resignation provided the latter is not the result of a breach of clause 10.1); or 10.2.3 the original employer party consents to the other party making such an offer or approach.\n10.3. In the event that a party is found to be in breach of clause 10.1 then that party shall pay the other party by way of liquidated damages and as its sole remedy an amount equal to 7 months of the applicable Key Employee's annual salary as at the time of breach. Each party agrees that such sum represents a genuine pre-estimate of the loss likely to be suffered.\n10.4. The undertakings in clause 10.1 apply to actions carried out by a party in any capacity, and whether directly or indirectly, on behalf of that party, or on behalf of or jointly with any other person.\n10.5. The covenant in clause 10.1 is considered fair and reasonable by the parties, but if any restriction is found to be unenforceable but would be valid if any part of it were deleted, or the period or area of application reduced, the restriction will apply with such modification as may be necessary to make it valid and enforceable.\n11. 11.1. PAYMENT Creditcall shall submit invoices for the Charges and the Customer shall pay the Charges in accordance with Schedule 4 (Charges).\n11.2.

If the Customer fails to pay any undisputed amount, in full and cleared funds, due by it under this Agreement, Creditcall may charge the Customer interest on the overdue amount (payable by the Customer immediately on demand) from the due date up to the date payment is received, after as well as before judgment, at the rate of 4% per annum above the base rate for the time being of Barclays Bank Pic. Such interest shall accrue on a daily basis and be compounded monthly until the date that full payment is received.\n11.6. The Charges are to be paid by the Customer in full and the Customer is not entitled by reason of set-off, counterclaim, abatement or other similar deduction to withhold payment of any undisputed amount due to Creditcall.\n11.7. Creditcall reserves the right to suspend provision of the Services where the Customer fails to pay any undisputed amount due under this Agreement on the due date for payment and remains in default for not less than 15 Working Days after being notified in writing to make such payment.\nv 10\/12\/2014 12.

The Customer agrees that it shall not, except as expressly provided in the Agreement, assign, sub-contract, transfer, mortgage, charge, declare a trust of or deal in any other manner with any or all of its rights and obligations under the Agreement other than to a Customer Group Company without the prior written consent of Creditcall (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Creditcall agrees that it shall not subcontract any of its obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Customer (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

No single or partial exercise of such right or remedy shall preclude or restrict the further exercise of that or any other right or remedy. Without prejudice to clause 14.1, the Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding of the parties in respect of its subject matter and supersedes all prior agreements, negotiations, discussions and any previous practice or course of dealing between the parties relating to the same.

Nothing in this clause shall limit or exclude any liability for fraud. No variation or addition to the Agreement shall be effective unless it is in writing and signed by the parties (or their authorised representatives). If any court or competent authority finds that any provision of this Agreement (or part of any provision) is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that provision or part-provision shall, to the extent required, be deemed to be deleted, and the validity and enforceability of the other provisions of the Agreement shall not be affected. If any invalid, unenforceable or illegal provision of the Agreement would be valid, enforceable and legal if some part of it were deleted, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to amend such provision such that, as amended, it is legal, valid and enforceable, and, to the greatest extent possible, achieves the parties' original commercial intention. v 10'12^2314 20.7. 20.8. 20.9. 20.10.

For purposes of this Agreement, the party providing Confidential Information (as that term is defined below), and such party’s employees, agents and affiliates shall be referred to as the “Disclosing Party” and the party receiving the Confidential Information and such party’s employees, agents and affiliates shall be referred to as the “Receiving Party.” 1. INTRODUCTION. The parties may disclose Confidential Information to each other during discussions to evaluate a potential business relationship (the “Purpose”) and the parties agree that this Agreement relates only to the Confidential Information disclosed in connection with the Purpose. 2. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. 2.1 “Confidential Information” may include the Disclosing Party’s intellectual property, clients, customer lists, business contacts, business plans, policies, procedures, techniques, know-how, standards, products, source or object code, product or service specifications, manuals, agreements, economic and financial information, marketing plans, data, reports, analyses, compilations, statistics, summaries, studies, and any other tangible or intangible information or any materials based thereon, furnished directly or indirectly by the Disclosing Party.

To the extent that any claim is made concerning the existence of moral rights in regard to the Work Product, Vendor agrees to waive and assign over to Fidelity, all such right, title and interest to the fullest extent permissible by Applicable Law. Where the rights of authorship cannot by law be transferred to Fidelity due to an assertion of moral rights, Vendor agrees to employ its best efforts to gain the agreement of the author of the Work Product to express his or her authorship on such Work Product in a manner prescribed by Fidelity. Vendor acknowledges that Fidelity and its assigns (if any) shall have the right to obtain and hold in their own name any Intellectual Property rights in and to the Work Product. Vendor agrees to execute any documents and take any other actions as may be necessary, or as Fidelity may request, to perfect Fidelity's ownership of any such Work Product. Vendor represents that it does not have any commitments to others under which Vendor is obligated to make any transfer or assignment of any portion of the Work Product in conflict with Vendor's obligations to Fidelity pursuant to this Agreement. Nothing in this Section shall preclude Vendor or Fidelity or its respective employees from using ideas, processes, concepts, know-how or techniques related to the delivery of Services, Work Product or Deliverables that are retained in the memories of such employees.

(ii) Fidelity shall have an additional period of time equal to the initial Testing Period to re-perform Acceptance Testing. If Fidelity notifies Vendor of its rejection of the Work Product and\/or Services after re-performance of Acceptance Testing, Vendor shall have an additional opportunity to correct such defects and submit a corrected version of the Deliverable to Fidelity for Acceptance Testing. (iii) If Fidelity determines that the defects have not been corrected after two (2) opportunities have been provide to Vendor as set forth in this Section 7.1(g) to correct the defects so that the Work Product and Services meet the Acceptance Criteria, Fidelity may, at its option, do one of the following by notifying Vendor: (A) extend the Cure Period to correct the defects and re-perform Acceptance Testing in accordance with the procedure set forth above; (B) accept the Work Product and\/or Services, as the case may be, and negotiate for lesser performance; or (C) terminate the applicable Work Order in whole or in part.

(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 11.1(b) above, the Receiving Party shall be permitted to disclose relevant aspects of the Protected Party’s Confidential Information to the Receiving Party’s and its Affiliates’ directors, officers, agents, subcontractors and employees to the extent that such disclosure is necessary for the performance of the Receiving Party’s obligations under this Agreement; provided, however, that: (i) the Receiving Party shall take all reasonable measures to ensure that the Confidential Information of the Protected Party is not disclosed or duplicated in contravention of the provisions of this Agreement by such directors, officers, agents, subcontractors and employees; (ii) the Receiving Party shall assume full responsibility for the acts or omissions of the third parties receiving the Confidential Information from or through the Receiving Party; and (iii) before disclosing any Confidential Information of the Protected Party, all such persons receiving Confidential Information shall (A) if not employees of the Receiving Party, be subject to a written confidentiality agreement with the Receiving Party; (B) have a need to know such Confidential Information for performance related to the Services; and (C) in the case of employees of the Receiving Party, have been informed of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information.

Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, the Receiving Party agrees that it shall not use, and shall not disclose to any other Party, any nonpublic personal information that it receives from the Protected Party in connection with this Agreement, except in accordance with this Agreement. 35 hdJ) (e) The obligation to treat information as Confidential Information as provided by this Section 11.1 (General Confidentiality Obligations) shall not apply to information that (i) shall be publicly available through no action of the Receiving Party in violation of this Agreement, (ii) shall have been in the Receiving Party’s possession prior to disclosure by the Protected Party, (iii) shall be developed by the Receiving Party independently and without reference to any Confidential Information that the Protected Party has disclosed to the Receiving Party or (iv) shall be obtained by the Receiving Party from third parties not known to the Receiving Party to be bound by an obligation of confidentiality to the Protected Party.

If such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, then the Receiving Party shall furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information, which in the written opinion of its counsel, is legally required, and the Receiving Party shall exercise its reasonable best efforts to obtain reasonable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded the Confidential Information. \/ (i) The Receiving Party acknowledges and agrees that, given the nature of the Confidential Information and the competitive impact and\/or other damage that may result to the Protected Party if information contained therein is disclosed to any third party in breach of the obligations set forth in this Agreement, money damages may not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party, and that, in addition to all other remedies, the Protected Party may be entitled to specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief as deemed proper or necessary by a court of competent jurisdiction as a remedy for any such breach. The Receiving Party further agrees to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy. 11.2. Fidelity Confidential Information Specifically. Except as otherwise expressly set forth on a Work Order, all Fidelity Confidential Information shall be specifically segmented from information of any third parties and separately safeguarded in accordance with the term and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

(b) Vendor will maintain appropriate physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to store, dispose of (if applicable) and secure Customer Information in order to protect it from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, alteration, loss and destruction. The safeguards used by Vendor to protect Customer Information will be no less than those used by Vendor to protect its own Confidential Information. In addition, Vendor will comply with any other security safeguards and standards required by this Agreement. (c) Vendor will control access to Customer Information and, except as required by law or as otherwise expressly permitted by this Agreement, permit access only to individuals who need access in connection with the Services and shall cause such individuals to maintain the confidentiality of Customer Information. (d) As between Fidelity and Vendor, Customer Information, and all applicable Intellectual Property rights embodied in the Customer Information, shall remain the property of Fidelity. Vendor shall, upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Master Agreement together with the Agreement Collateral Documents, or any applicable Work Order pursuant to which the Customer Information was disclosed, or upon Fidelity’s earlier request, return to Fidelity all Customer Information or destroy it, as specified by Fidelity. Upon Fidelity's request, Vendor shall provide to Fidelity a certificate executed by an officer overseeing such process attesting to the completion of such request. (e) Vendor shall comply with all privacy and data protection laws, rules and regulations that are, or may in the future be, applicable to Customer Information or the Services, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (P.L. 106-102) (15 U.S.C. §6801 et seq.), the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. §1681 et seq.), The Data Protection Act 1998 and Directive 95\/46\/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data. To the extent that in providing the Services, Vendor has access to any ‘personal data’ (as defined in Directive 95\/46\/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (the “Directive”)) from a member state of the European Union, then Vendor will comply with the Addendum set forth hereto as Master Agreement Exhibit D. (f) Vendor covenants that Vendor has (i) established and will maintain appropriate policies and procedures to comply with its obligations concerning Customer Information under this Agreement, (ii) provided, and will provide training on such policies and procedures for employees with access to Customer Information and (iii) established and will 38 enforce appropriate disciplinary measures for individuals who fail to comply with such policies and procedures. (g) Vendor will promptly notify Fidelity in writing if it becomes aware of (i) any breach of its information security procedures, (ii) any loss of Customer Information, (iii) any attempt to obtain unauthorized access, disclosure or use of Customer Information or (iv) any attempt to alter or destroy any Customer Information.

(h) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, Fidelity has the right to terminate one or more Work Orders (in whole or in part), immediately without penalty for failure of Vendor to comply with its obligations concerning Customer Information set forth herein. Vendor acknowledges that the unauthorized disclosure of Customer Information is likely to cause irreparable injury to Fidelity and that, in the event of a violation or threatened violation of any of these obligations, Fidelity shall have no adequate remedy at law and shall therefore be entitled to enforce each such obligation by temporary or permanent injunctive or mandatory relief obtained in any court of competent jurisdiction without the necessity of proving damages or the inadequacy of money damages, posting any bond or other security, and without prejudice to any other rights and remedies which may be available, at law or in equity. (i) Vendor will not use Customer Information to contact any Person except if required by any Applicable Law, provided that any such contact does not involve marketing or solicitation of products or services. 11.5. Access to Fidelity Software. Vendor acknowledges that the Fidelity Software is proprietary and trade secret property of Fidelity, and Vendor’s use and access of the Fidelity Software shall be limited to the use and access only as necessary to provide the Services to Fidelity or a Fidelity Customer pursuant to this Agreement or a Work Order hereunder. Vendor further acknowledges that Fidelity does not permit the access and use of Fidelity Software by a party other than Fidelity or a Fidelity Customer except as specifically agreed in writing by Fidelity. Based upon the trade secret and proprietary nature of the Fidelity Software: (a) Vendor agrees that until March 31, 2010 and for the one (1) year period following this date, if Vendor receives a request for information, or other widely circulated solicitation from any Fidelity Customer for application development, programming, implementation, maintenance that involve the Fidelity Software which Vendor has actively worked on under this Agreement, Vendor shall inform Fidelity of such solicitation and bid on such opportunity only with Fidelity. For the avoidance of doubt, Fidelity may also elect to bid on such same opportunity on its own without involving Vendor. If any of the Fidelity Customers selects the joint bid from Vendor and Fidelity to perform services, but later requests in writing that Fidelity not be involved in the work, Vendor shall be entitled to perform services on Fidelity Software with resources who have not previously performed any Services for Fidelity under this Agreement. For avoidance of doubt, Vendor shall not on its own or through a third party solicit application development, programming, implementation, maintenance and other similar projects to its financial institution customers relating to the Fidelity Software. Also, for the avoidance of 39  doubt, nothing in this Agreement shall preclude Vendor from performing services for any of its customers on non-Fidelity Software. (b) In the event Vendor is asked to respond to a request for information or request for proposal with respect to the provision of application development, programming, implementation, maintenance or consulting services with respect to any Fidelity Software which Vendor has actively worked on under this Agreement, Vendor shall confirm with Fidelity whether Fidelity has been asked to respond to such request, and: (i) in the event Fidelity has not been asked to respond to such request, Vendor will only respond to, nor enter into an agreement with respect to, such request unless such response or agreement is done so with the participation of, or teaming with, Fidelity. (ii) in the event Fidelity has been asked to respond to such request, Vendor will not respond to such request unless Fidelity requests Vendor to participate, or team, with Fidelity in Fidelity’s response to such request. 11.6 Expiration or Termination of the Master Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Fidelity shall, in the event of a termination or expiration of this Master Agreement, be permitted to enter into an agreement with any other vendor for the provision of Services and any similar services or the development or maintenance of any Work Product or maintenance of any Vendor Software licensed to Fidelity or any of its Affiliates. In connection therewith, Fidelity shall be permitted to disclose any Confidential Information of Vendor or any of its Affiliates to such other vendors as necessary for the provision of such Services or other similar services or the development or maintenance of such Work Product or maintenance of such Vendor Software; provided such other vendors enter into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements to protect such Confidential Information and use such Confidential Information solely for the purposes stated above to support Fidelity. .12.

The Implementation Period may be extended by mutual agreement of the Parties. (c) Completion. The Implementation Plan will set forth amounts to be paid to Worldpay by Service Partner, in the form of service credits or checks (if credits cannot be reasonably consumed by Worldpay) if Service Partner fails to meet Implementation Milestones or to complete the Implementation in accordance with the time period set forth in the Implementation Plan and such failure is attributable to Service Partner. Unless Service Partner’s failure to meet the Implementation Milestones is solely and directly due to Worldpay’s breach of its obligations hereunder, Service Provider will provide Worldpay the agreed service credits or checks for such failure. Service Partner agrees that these amounts will be paid whether or not Worldpay has paid any amount to Service Partner and regardless of any limitation of liability set forth in Section 16.

The FCPA broadly prohibits U.S. firms and persons from offering money or anything of value to any foreign government official for the purpose of influencing such official. The consequences of violating the FCPA are extremely severe, including possible civil and criminal penalties. In the United States, nothing of value (for example, gifts or entertainment) may be provided to government personnel unless clearly permitted by law and any applicable regulation. Therefore, no payment from Worldpay’s or Service Partner’s funds or assets related to the Services shall be made to or for the benefit of a representative of any domestic or foreign government (or subdivision thereof), labor union, or any current or prospective customer or supplier for the purpose of improperly obtaining a desired government action, or any sale, purchase, contract, or other commercial benefit.

In addition, Service Partner acknowledges that Worldpay may seek to ensure Service Partner’s compliance with the Rules and the Laws, and, in conformance therewith, Worldpay shall be entitled to conduct such audit and review of Service Partner as permitted in accordance with this Agreement. Service Provider agrees to reasonably cooperate with and respond promptly to all Worldpay requests for information, records, logs, notes, attestations, procedures, and any other materials as may reasonably be made during the normal course of assessments, audits and inspections of Worldpay processes and systems by its assessors, auditors and regulators, including, but not limited to, those assessing the compliance of Worldpay with the PCI DSS or PA-DSS if applicable as stated in a SOW, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 7.16(b). 4.7 Security (a) Obligations.

Neither party shall have any obligation respecting the change until an appropriate change order or amendment to the applicable SOW is executed and delivered by both Parties. The Change Control Procedures will contain a procedure that allows Worldpay to exercise the approval rights set forth above and complies with the requirements set out below: (i) Impact Assessment.

Accordingly, if Service Partner fails to meet any such Service Levels due to circumstances within its control, in addition to any other remedy Worldpay may have, Service Partner will pay Worldpay the service level credits specified in the applicable SOW. Service Partner will remit such payment by wire transfer to Worldpay within forty five days after the end of the month in which such failure occurred. Service level credits will be deemed to be price reductions reflecting the diminished value of the Services as a result of the failure. Worldpay shall also have any remedies available to Worldpay under this MSA or any Service Level Agreement, at law or in equity, including the right to terminate this MSA or any Services . If Worldpay recovers other monetary damages as a result of Service Partner’s failure to meet one or more Service Levels, Service Partner will be entitled to set-off against such damages any credits paid for the failures giving rise to such recovery.

Service Partner also shall provide Worldpay with information and access to the measurement and monitoring tools and procedures utilized by Service Partner for purposes of audit verification. Worldpay shall not be required to pay for such measurement and monitoring tools or the resource utilization associated with their use unless Worldpay’s request requires a significant or material enhancement or expansion of a reporting system already in place.

Service Partner action plan developed hereunder shall include the specific measures to be taken by Service Partner and the dates by which each such action shall be completed. Following implementation of such action plan, Service Partner will conduct follow-up surveys with the affected Worldpay users and management to confirm that the cause of any dissatisfaction has been addressed and that the level of satisfaction has improved. If Service Partner fails to attain the agreed upon levels of satisfaction or fails to take the actions set forth in the action plan by the agreed upon dates, Worldpay shall be entitled to any remedies provided by this MSA or as agreed upon by the parties. Service Partner shall be responsible for all costs associated with conducting the customer satisfaction survey process. 5.5 Notice of Adverse Impact. If Service Partner becomes aware of any failure by Service Partner to comply with its obligations under this MSA or any other situation (i) that has impacted or reasonably could impact the maintenance of Worldpay’s financial integrity or internal controls, the accuracy of Worldpay’s financial, accounting or human resources records and reports or compliance with Worldpay standards, or (ii) that has had or reasonably could have any other material adverse impact on the Services in question or the impacted business operations of Worldpay, then Service Partner will immediately inform Worldpay in writing of such situation and the impact or expected impact and Service Partner and Worldpay will meet to formulate an action plan to minimize or eliminate the impact of the situation. 5.6 Termination.

(a) Subject to clause (d) below, neither Party shall be liable for any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations under this MSA to the extent such failure or delay both: (i) is caused, directly or indirectly, without fault by such Party, by: fire, flood, earthquake, elements of nature or acts of God; acts of war, terrorism, riots, civil disorders, rebellions or revolutions; quarantines, embargoes and other similar governmental action; or any other cause beyond the reasonable control of such Party; and (ii) could not have been prevented by reasonable precautions and cannot reasonably be circumvented by the non-performing Party through the use of alternate sources, work-around plans or other means (including, in the case of Service Partner, compliance with Service Partner’s obligations with respect to the provision of the disaster recovery services as set forth in any Service Agreement). Events meeting both of the criteria set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above are referred to collectively as “Force Majeure Events”. The Parties expressly acknowledge that, except as otherwise expressly provided in a Service Agreement, Force Majeure Events do not include third party non-performance or the failure of an individual component or group of components (including but not limited to, hardware and software) used in delivery of the Services. However, the failure of a public telecommunications network or service will be considered to be a Force Majeure Event if such failure otherwise meets the definition of Force Majeure and Service Partner is unable notwithstanding all reasonable efforts to provide the Services using alternate or backup telecommunications facilities or providers that it has undertaken in a Service Agreement to have available for use in the event that the public telecommunications network or services are not available. (b) Subject to clause (d) below, upon the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, the non-performing Party shall be excused from any further performance or observance of the affected obligation(s) for as long as such circumstances prevail and such Party continues to attempt to recommence performance or observance whenever and to whatever extent possible without delay. Any Party so delayed in its performance will immediately notify the other by telephone or by the most timely means otherwise available (to be confirmed in writing within two (2) Business Days of the inception of such delay) and describe in reasonable detail the circumstances causing such delay. (c) If a Force Majeure Event causes (i) a Service Failure or (ii) a delay in the performance of any Services for more than 72 hours, unless such other time frame is agreed to in writing, Worldpay may, at its option, and in addition to any rights Worldpay may have pursuant to this Section 16.6 procure such Services from an alternate source (with Service Partner reimbursing Worldpay to the extent Worldpay pre-paid for the affected Page 64 of 182 con-09385 DocuSign Envelope ID: 43A80C49-0788-4EF2-BBDA-E8BB4A0C13AA Services) until Service Partner is again able to provide such Services, or the Parties will supply a work around solution. (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 16, a Force Majeure Event shall not relieve Service Partner of its obligation to implement successfully all of the Services relating to disaster recovery services that are included in any SOW within the time period described in such SOW. (e) If the period of non-performance exceeds fifteen days from the receipt of notice of the Force Majeure Event, and in the case of Service Partner, Service Partner has failed to implement the BCP related to the Services being terminated, the party whose ability to perform has not been so affected may give written notice to terminate this MSA. In addition, all amounts payable to Service Partner hereunder will be equitably adjusted in a manner such that Worldpay is not required to pay any amounts for Services that Worldpay is not receiving. (f) Without limiting Service Partner’s obligations under this Agreement, whenever a Force Majeure Event causes Service Partner to allocate limited resources between or among Service Partner’s customers, Worldpay will be treated at least as favorably as Service Partner’s other substantially similarly situated customers expending comparable amounts on an annual basis for the same or substantially the same or similar services and will be treated similarly with other of Service Partner’s substantially similarly situated customers . (g) Upon the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, Service Partner will implement promptly, as appropriate, the disaster recovery and business continuity plans and provide disaster recovery and business continuity services in accordance therewith. The occurrence of a Force Majeure Event will not relieve Service Partner of its obligation to implement its disaster recovery or business continuity plan and provide disaster recovery or business continuity services. 17.

In addition to the provisions herein, in the event that Worldpay institutes such action in India, Service Partner consents to the jurisdiction of the municipal, state, federal or national Indian court having jurisdiction over the subject matter of the alleged breach, and the Parties agree that Indian law shall apply to the procedural issues and, if so agreed by Parties, to the substantive issues.

Change Management CHANGE PROCESS Changes are defined as work activities not originally planned for as defined by the Project SOW and\/or Project Work Schedule. Changes include but are not limited to: • Any scope items not listed in this SOW • Provision or development of Deliverables not included in this SOW • Changes impacting the overall delivery schedule • Any change that materially reduces the complexity of the configuration, and\/or eliminates a phase of development. A formal Change Control Process will be used to identify, track, assess, and approve changes to the Project. Service Partner and Worldpay will follow this process to classify, prioritize, approve, or reject changes. Change requests need to be clearly defined, including cost and schedule implications, to allow Service Page 88 of 182 DocuSign Envelope ID: 43A80C49-0788-4EF2-BBDA-E8BB4A0C13AA Partner and Worldpay to make appropriate decisions. Service Partner will obtain prior authorization and approval of Worldpay before starting work on any changes. 9. SOW Changes Either Worldpay or Service Partner may request a change to this SOW subject to the following Project Change Control Process. The requesting Project Manager will submit all requests (a “Project Change Request” or “PCR”) for a change in writing to the other Project Manager. The PCR will describe at a reasonable level of detail the change, the rationale for the change and the impact the change may have on this SOW, both if it is accepted and if it is rejected. Service Partner Project Manager will be responsible for tracking all PCR Requests. The Worldpay Project Manager and Service Partner Project Manager will review the PCR and either: a. Authorize the change by signing the PCR; or b. Agree in writing to submit the PCR to Service Partner Project Manager for further investigation. The investigation will determine the technical merits and the effect on the price, schedule and other terms and conditions that may result from the implementation of the PCR. The Worldpay Project Manager and Service Partner Project Manager will then agree to mutually approve or reject the PCR; or c. Reject the PCR. If rejected, the PCR will be returned to the requesting individual along with the reason for rejection. This SOW is amended by a PCR if the PCR is accepted and signed unaltered by the Worldpay Project Manager and the Service Partner Project Manager and then becomes a change authorization. 10. Communication Plan < The purpose of this section is to document Communication Plan that supports the work contained in the SOW.

Service Level Agreement\/Performance Standards The objective of all projects at Worldpay is to optimize time, cost, and quality, relative to the expected business value to be received from projects. The three pillars of Time, Cost and Quality form the Service Partner performance standards that govern the delivery of this SOW. The Penalty Scoring listed in this section follows the Penalty Scoring Model set forth in the MSA, and that is represented in the Relationship SLAs. • Service Levels should be monitored and measured to assess the Service Partner’s performance against specified metrics. • Service Levels create incentives to fix issues and improve Services • Worldpay must have the ability to add or remove Service Levels to adapt to changes and\/or address perceived deficiencies. 14.1 Time (Milestone Attainment) - Each of the milestones listed above in the 5.0 Milestones & Efforts Hours section will be measured on Target Completion Date attainment. Worldpay expects that Service Partner will achieve an Actual Completion Date that is on or before the Target Completion Date for all Project milestones. This table references the Penalty Scores for not achieving this result: # Milestone Target Completion Date Actual Completion Date Variance (Actual - Target, 0 if Negative Variance % ((Variance\/Targ et End Date - Target Start Date) X 100) Penalty Scored 0% 0 1% -10% 1 11% - 20% 2 21% - 30% 3 31% - 40% 4 >40% 5\n1 2 3 14.2 Cost (Effort Hours) - Given the Hourly Rate Model employed in the Master Services Agreement, the “Cost” to deliver the items in this SOW is reflected in the number of Effort Hours listed above in the 5.0 Milestones & Efforts Hours section. Unless altered via a Worldpay signed SOW Change Request, Worldpay will not pay for any costs that exceed the Effort Hours x Hourly Rate calculation. Therefore, the performance criteria for Effort Hours attainment are non-negotiable at 0% variance. 14.3 Quality (a) Delivery to (for Projects driven by the PMO PLC Define 2.2 Business Requirements artifact) It is expected that Service Partner will fully deliver on all of the Requirements listed in the Request for Proposal from which this SOW was precipitated. Failure to fully deliver on all Requirements will not only result in the Penalty Scores as listed below, but it is also gives Worldpay the right to terminate this SOW in accordance with the MSA: Page 90 of 182 DocuSign Envelope ID: 43A80C49-0788-4EF2-BBDA-E8BB4A0C13AA Total Requirements Total Requirements Delivered Total Requirements Delivered\/Total Requirements 100% 0 <100% 5\n\n(b) Changes in Scope (for Projects where Service Partner is defining the PMO PLC Define 2.2 Business Requirements artifact) It is expected that Service Partner will accurately and fully define all of the Requirements for the scope outlined in the Request for Proposal from which this SOW was precipitated. Requirements that were missed during the Define phase of the PLC, and later discovered, must be added into the Requirements document via a Scope Change. The occurrences of missed Requirements greatly impacts the probability of Project success, therefore Worldpay takes these occurrences very seriously and expects that 100% of all Requirements be captured during the Define phase. This table references the Penalty Scores for not achieving this result: Total Requirements Total Requirements Missed Total Requirements Missed\/Total Requirements 0% 0 1% - 5% 1 6% -10% 3 >10%% 5\n\n(c) Coding Defects (for software development projects) It is expected that all software development work products be delivered to Worldpay by Service Partner defect free. A defect is defined as errors, invalid results, poor code run time performance, memory leakage, failure to meet the specified requirements, extra requirements, logic flaws, calculation errors, security violations, etc. Software defects identified after delivery to Worldpay cause rework, added Worldpay FTE cost and schedule risk. Given this, Worldpay takes the occurrences of defects very seriously and expects all deliverables to be 100% defect free. This table references the Penalty Scores for not achieving this result:_ Total Requirements Total Defects Total Defects\/Total Requirements 0% 0 1% - 5% 1 6% - 10% 3 >10%% 5\n\n12. Additional Terms This SOW remains in effect until <End Date>, unless terminated in accordance with the terms of the Agreement or extended in writing by the mutual agreement of the parties hereto. Worldpay agrees to provide <Service Partner> not less than four (4) weeks prior written notice of its election to terminate this SOW. 13.

Rate adjustments will be made on July 1 annually, and will be in effect for the next 12-month period. The performance criteria and rate adjustment formula are as follows:\nDescription and Definitions Service Partner reserves the right to increase List Prices and Unit Prices for Service Partner Products no more than once in any consecutive twelve (12) month period, upon not less than ninety (90) days’ prior written notice, specifying such revised List Prices and Unit Prices, and based upon actual and documented increases in Service Partner’s direct labor and material costs. No annual increase for any Service Partner Product, (exclusive of any Discount) shall exceed the lesser of: (i) an amount no greater than the percentage of any increase over the preceding twelve (12) month period in the Consumer Price Index; or (ii) five percent (5%); provided, however, no such annual increase shall exceed Service Partner’s then- current published prices for the same or substantially similar products. Any Purchase Order delivered to Service Partner before the effective date of any price increase shall not be subject to such increase. Prices contained in any price quotation submitted by Service Partner to Worldpay shall remain firm for not less than ninety (90) days. “Consumer Price Index”, as of any date, means the Consumer Price Index (Current Series) for “All Urban Consumers, U.S. City Average, All Items, Not Seasonally Ad-justed,” as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor (base year 1982-84=100; if the base for the Index is so changed that 1982-84 prices are no longer taken as representing 100, an appropriate adjustment will be applied to the published indices so as to relate them to the aforesaid base in which 1982-84 prices are taken as represent-ing 100), as of the most recent calendar month for which the Index is published prior to such date. In the event the Consumer Price Index is discontinued, such other substantially similar governmental index or publication, as chosen by the Parties as a reasonable replacement, shall be substituted therefor.\nEffective Date for First Adjustment July 1,2018\nAdjustment Performance Requirement Service Partner must meet or exceed performance expectations as outlined in the MSA and SLA during the 12-month period ending _ (the Effective Period) to be Page 117 of 182\nDocuSign Envelope ID: 43A80C49-0788-4EF2-BBDA-E8BB4A0C13AA Schedule H - Rate Adjustment Formula considered for a rate adjustment.\nAdjustment Calculation Worldpay will calculate : For US, the adjustment shall be based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor (the “AHE”) Consumer Price Index Numbers for the most recently reported 12-month period.

Having conducted this assessment, Worldpay consents to Service Partner's use of these Special Subprocessors and agrees that the extent of Service Partner's liability to Worldpay for any breach of this Schedule O, the Agreement or the Standard Contractual Clauses that is caused by any of the Special Subprocessors shall be limited strictly to the extent of the liability which Service Partner is able to recover from that Special Subprocessor under its terms and conditions. Service Partner may, subject to Worldpay’s right to object during the Change Period, add or make changes to the Special Subprocessors. In such cases, Service Partner shall give Worldpay an opportunity to review the terms and conditions that Service Partner has entered or will enter into with these Special Subprocessors. If Worldpay reasonably objects in writing to Service Partner's appointment of an additional Special Subprocessor within 30 days before the end of the Change Period, Service Partner will not appoint the additional Special Subprocessor and will work with Worldpay to find an alternative Special Subprocessor reasonably satisfactory to Worldpay and Service Partner. 7. The Service Partner acknowledges that any consent to a Subprocessor provided by Worldpay may be withdrawn by Worldpay if and to the extent that Worldpay reasonably believes that the Personal Data or the rights of the Data Subjects may be compromised by the relevant subcontractor, subject to the relevant notice and termination provisions in the relevant Subprocessor’s agreement with the Service Partner.

These Clauses are entered into pursuant to the Master Services Agreement (“MSA”), by and between Worldpay, LLC (“Worldpay”) and Cognizant Worldwide Limited (“Service Partner”), dated February 27, 2019 (as amended from time to time, the “MSA”). Section 16.3 and 16.4(b) of the MSA applies to the parties’ liability under these Clauses. The foregoing shall not be taken to limit or exclude the data importer’s liability to any data subject under these Clauses. Definitions For the purposes of the clauses: (a) “personal data”, “special categories of data\/sensitive data”, “process\/processing”, “controller”, “processor”, “data subject” and “supervisory authority\/authority” shall have the same meaning as in Directive 95\/46\/EC of 24 October 1995 (whereby “the authority” shall mean the competent data protection authority in the territory in which the data exporter is established); (b) “the data exporter” shall mean the controller who transfers the personal data; (c) “the data importer” shall mean the controller who agrees to receive from the data exporter personal data for further processing in accordance with the terms of these clauses and who is not subject to a third country’s system ensuring adequate protection; Page 155 of 182 DocuSign Envelope ID: 43A80C49-0788-4EF2-BBDA-E8BB4A0C13AA (d) “clauses” shall mean these contractual clauses, which are a free-standing document that does not incorporate commercial business terms established by the parties under separate commercial arrangements. The details of the transfer (as well as the personal data covered) are specified in Annex B, which forms an integral part of the clauses. Clause 1 Obligations of the data exporter The data exporter warrants and undertakes that: (a) The personal data have been collected, processed and transferred in accordance with the laws applicable to the data exporter. (b) It has used reasonable efforts to determine that the data importer is able to satisfy its legal obligations under these clauses. (c) It will provide the data importer, when so requested, with copies of relevant data protection laws or references to them (where relevant, and not including legal advice) of the country in which the data exporter is established. (d) It will respond to enquiries from data subjects and the authority concerning processing of the personal data by the data importer, unless the parties have agreed that the data importer will so respond, in which case the data exporter will still respond to the extent reasonably possible and with the information reasonably available to it if the data importer is unwilling or unable to respond. Responses will be made within a reasonable time. (e) It will make available, upon request, a copy of the clauses to data subjects who are third party beneficiaries under clause III, unless the clauses contain confidential information, in which case it may remove such information.

However, the data exporter shall abide by a decision of the authority regarding access to the full text of the clauses by data subjects, as long as data subjects have agreed to respect the confidentiality of the confidential information removed. The data exporter shall also provide a copy of the clauses to the authority where required. Clause 2 Obligations of the data importer The data importer warrants and undertakes that: (a) It will have in place appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect the personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access, and which provide a level of security appropriate to the risk represented by the processing and the nature of the data to be protected. (b) It will have in place procedures so that any third party it authorises to have access to the personal data, including processors, will respect and maintain the confidentiality and security of the personal data.

This provision does not apply to persons authorised or required by law or regulation to have access to the personal data. Page 156 of 182 DocuSign Envelope ID: 43A80C49-0788-4EF2-BBDA-E8BB4A0C13AA (c) It has no reason to believe, at the time of entering into these clauses, in the existence of any local laws that would have a substantial adverse effect on the guarantees provided for under these clauses, and it will inform the data exporter (which will pass such notification on to the authority where required) if it becomes aware of any such laws.

(f) At the request of the data exporter, it will provide the data exporter with evidence of financial resources sufficient to fulfil its responsibilities under clause III (which may include insurance coverage). (g) Upon reasonable request of the data exporter, it will submit its data processing facilities, data files and documentation needed for processing to reviewing, auditing and\/or certifying by the data exporter (or any independent or impartial inspection agents or auditors, selected by the data exporter and not reasonably objected to by the data importer) to ascertain compliance with the warranties and undertakings in these clauses, with reasonable notice and during regular business hours. The request will be subject to any necessary consent or approval from a regulatory or supervisory authority within the country of the data importer, which consent or approval the data importer will attempt to obtain in a timely fashion.

Data importer to indicate which option it selects: [x] Initials of data importer:_; (i) It will not disclose or transfer the personal data to a third party data controller located outside the European Economic Area (EEA) unless it notifies the data exporter about the transfer and (i) the third party data controller processes the personal data in accordance with a Commission decision finding that a third country provides adequate protection, or (ii) the third party data controller becomes a signatory to these clauses or another data transfer agreement approved by a competent authority in the EU, or Page 157 of 182 DocuSign Envelope ID: 43A80C49-0788-4EF2-BBDA-E8BB4A0C13AA (iii) data subjects have been given the opportunity to object, after having been informed of the purposes of the transfer, the categories of recipients and the fact that the countries to which data is exported may have different data protection standards, or (iv) with regard to onward transfers of sensitive data, data subjects have given their unambiguous consent to the onward transfer Clause 3 Liability and third party rights (a) Each party shall be liable to the other parties for damages it causes by any breach of these clauses. Liability as between the parties is limited to actual damage suffered. Punitive damages (i.e. damages intended to punish a party for its outrageous conduct) are specifically excluded. Each party shall be liable to data subjects for damages it causes by any breach of third party rights under these clauses. This does not affect the liability of the data exporter under its data protection law. (b) The parties agree that a data subject shall have the right to enforce as a third party beneficiary this clause and clauses I(b), I(d), I(e), II(a), II(c), II(d), II(e), II(h), II(i), III(a), V, VI(d) and VII against the data importer or the data exporter, for their respective breach of their contractual obligations, with regard to his personal data, and accept jurisdiction for this purpose in the data exporter’s country of establishment. In cases involving allegations of breach by the data importer, the data subject must first request the data exporter to take appropriate action to enforce his rights against the data importer; if the data exporter does not take such action within a reasonable period (which under normal circumstances would be one month), the data subject may then enforce his rights against the data importer directly. A data subject is entitled to proceed directly against a data exporter that has failed to use reasonable efforts to determine that the data importer is able to satisfy its legal obligations under these clauses (the data exporter shall have the burden to prove that it took reasonable efforts). Clause 4 Law applicable to the clauses These clauses shall be governed by the law of the country in which the data exporter is established, with the exception of the laws and regulations relating to processing of the personal data by the data importer under clause II(h), which shall apply only if so selected by the data importer under that clause.

(b) In the event that: (i) the transfer of personal data to the data importer has been temporarily suspended by the data exporter for longer than one month pursuant to paragraph (a); (ici)ompliance by the data importer with these clauses would put it in breach of its legal or regulatory obligations in the country of import; (iii) the data importer is in substantial or persistent breach of any warranties or undertakings given by it under these clauses; (iv) a final decision against which no further appeal is possible of a competent court of the data exporter’s country of establishment or of the authority rules that there has been a breach of the clauses by the data importer or the data exporter; or (v) a petition is presented for the administration or winding up of the data importer, whether in its personal or business capacity, which petition is not dismissed within the applicable period for such dismissal under applicable law; a winding up order is made; a receiver is appointed over any of its assets; a trustee in bankruptcy is appointed, if the data importer is an individual; a company voluntary arrangement is commenced by it; or any equivalent event in any jurisdiction occurs then the data exporter, without prejudice to any other rights which it may have against the data importer, shall be entitled to terminate these clauses, in which case the authority shall be informed where required.

(d) The parties agree that the termination of these clauses at any time, in any circumstances and for whatever reason (except for termination under clause VI(c)) does not exempt them from the obligations and\/or conditions under the clauses as regards the processing of the personal data transferred.

The personal data must be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are transferred and further processed. 3. Transparency: Data subjects must be provided with information necessary to ensure fair processing (such as information about the purposes of processing and about the transfer), unless such information has already been given by the data exporter. 4. Security and confidentiality: Technical and organisational security measures must be taken by the data controller that are appropriate to the risks, such as against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access, presented by the processing. Any person acting under the authority of the data controller, including a processor, must not process the data except on instructions from the data controller. 5. Rights of access, rectification, deletion and objection: As provided in Article 12 of Directive 95\/46\/EC, data subjects must, whether directly or via a third party, be provided with the personal information about them that an organisation holds, except for requests which are manifestly abusive, based on unreasonable intervals or their number or repetitive or systematic nature, or for which access need not be granted under the law of the country of the data exporter. Provided that the authority has given its prior approval, access need also not be granted when doing so would be likely to seriously harm the interests of the data importer or other organisations dealing with the data importer and such interests are not overridden by the interests for fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject. The sources of the personal data need not be identified when this is not possible by reasonable efforts, or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated. Data subjects must be able to have the personal information about them rectified, amended, or deleted where it is inaccurate or processed against these principles. If there are compelling grounds to doubt the legitimacy of the request, the organisation may require further justifications before proceeding to rectification, amendment or deletion. Notification of any rectification, amendment or deletion to third parties to whom the data have been disclosed need not be made when this involves a disproportionate effort. A data subject must also be able to object to the processing of the personal data relating to him if there are compelling legitimate grounds relating to his particular situation. The burden of proof for any refusal rests on the data importer, and the data subject may always challenge a refusal before the authority. 6. Sensitive data: The data importer shall take such additional measures (e.g. relating to security) as are necessary to protect such sensitive data in accordance with its obligations under clause II. 7. Data used for marketing purposes: Where data are processed for the purposes of direct marketing, effective procedures should exist allowing the data subject at any time to “opt-out” from having his data used for such purposes. 8. Automated decisions: For purposes hereof “automated decision” shall mean a decision by the data exporter or the data importer which produces legal effects concerning a data subject or significantly affects a data subject and which is based solely on automated processing of personal data intended to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to him, such as his performance at work, creditworthiness, reliability, conduct, etc. The data importer shall not make any automated decisions concerning data subjects, except when: (a) (i) such decisions are made by the data importer in entering into Page 163 of 182 DocuSign Envelope ID: 43A80C49-0788-4EF2-BBDA-E8BB4A0C13AA or performing a contract with the data subject, and (ii) (the data subject is given an opportunity to discuss the results of a relevant automated decision with a representative of the parties making such decision or otherwise to make representations to that parties. Or (b) where otherwise provided by the law of the data exporter.

These Clauses are entered into pursuant to the Master Services Agreement (“MSA”), by and between Worldpay, LLC (“Worldpay”) and Cognizant Worldwide Limited (“Service Partner”), dated February 27, 2019 (as amended from time to time, the “MSA”). Section 16.3 and 16.4(b) of the MSA applies to the parties’ liability under these Clauses. The foregoing shall not be taken to limit or exclude the data importer’s liability to any data subject under these Clauses. Clause 1 Definitions For the purposes of the Clauses: (a) 'personal data', 'special categories of data', 'process\/processing', 'controller', 'processor', 'data subject' and 'supervisory authority' shall have the same meaning as in Directive 95\/46\/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data1; (b) 'the data exporter' means the controller who transfers the personal data; (c) 'the data importer' means the processor who agrees to receive from the data exporter personal data intended for processing on his behalf after the transfer in accordance with his instructions and the terms of the Clauses and who is not subject to a third country's system ensuring adequate protection within the meaning of Article 25(1) of Directive 95\/46\/EC; (d) 'the sub-processor' means any processor engaged by the data importer or by any other sub-processor of the data importer who agrees to receive from the data importer or from any other sub-processor of the data importer personal data exclusively intended for processing activities to be carried out on behalf of the data exporter after the transfer in accordance with his instructions, the terms of the Clauses and the terms of the written subcontract; Parties may reproduce definitions and meanings contained in Directive 95\/46\/EC within this Clause if they considered it better for the contract to stand alone. Page 169 of 182 DocuSign Envelope ID: 43A80C49-0788-4EF2-BBDA-E8BB4A0C13AA (e) 'the applicable data protection law' means the legislation protecting the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals and, in particular, their right to privacy with respect to the processing of personal data applicable to a data controller in the Member State in which the data exporter is established. (f) 'technical and organizational security measures' means those measures aimed at protecting personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, in particular where the processing involves the transmission of data over a network, and against all other unlawful forms of processing.

The data subject can enforce against the data importer this Clause, Clause 5(a) to (e) and (g), Clause 6, Clause 7, Clause 8(2), and Clauses 9 to 12, in cases where the data exporter has factually disappeared or has ceased to exist in law unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract or by operation of law, as a result of which it takes on the rights and obligations of the data exporter, in which case the data subject can enforce them against such entity. 3. The data subject can enforce against the subprocessor this Clause, Clause 5(a) to (e) and (g), Clause 6, Clause 7, Clause 8(2), and Clauses 9 to 12, in cases where both the data exporter and the data importer have factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract or by operation of law as a result of which it takes on the rights and obligations of the data exporter, in which case the data subject can enforce them against such entity. Such third-party liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses. 4. The parties do not object to a data subject being represented by an association or other body if the data subject so expressly wishes and if permitted by national law. Clause 4 Obligations of the data exporter The data exporter agrees and warrants: (a) that the processing, including the transfer itself, of the personal data has been and will continue to be carried out in accordance with the relevant provisions of the applicable data protection law (and, where applicable, has been notified to the relevant authorities of the Member State where the data exporter is established) and does not violate the relevant provisions of that State; Page 170 of 182 DocuSign Envelope ID: 43A80C49-0788-4EF2-BBDA-E8BB4A0C13AA (b) that it has instructed and throughout the duration of the personal data processing services will instruct the data importer to process the personal data transferred only on the data exporter's behalf and in accordance with the applicable data protection law and the Clauses; (c) that the data importer will provide sufficient guarantees in respect of the technical and organisational security measures specified in Appendix 2 to this contract; (d) that after assessment of the requirements of the applicable data protection law, the security measures are appropriate to protect personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access, in particular where the processing involves the transmission of data over a network, and against all other unlawful forms of processing, and that these measures ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks presented by the processing and the nature of the data to be protected having regard to the state of the art and the cost of their implementation; (e) that it will ensure compliance with the security measures; (f) that, if the transfer involves special categories of data, the data subject has been informed or will be informed before, or as soon as possible after, the transfer that its data could be transmitted to a third country not providing adequate protection within the meaning of Directive 95\/46\/EC; (g) to forward any notification received from the data importer or any subprocessor pursuant to Clause 5(b) and Clause 8(3) to the data protection supervisory authority if the data exporter decides to continue the transfer or to lift the suspension; (h) to make available to the data subjects upon request a copy of the Clauses, with the exception of Appendix 2, and a summary description of the security measures, as well as a copy of any contract for subprocessing services which has to be made in accordance with the Clauses, unless the Clauses or the contract contain commercial information, in which case it may remove such commercial information; (i) that, in the event of subprocessing, the processing activity is carried out in accordance with Clause 11 by a subprocessor providing at least the same level of protection for the personal data and the rights of data subject as the data importer under the Clauses; and (j) that it will ensure compliance with Clause 4(a) to (i). Clause 5 Obligations of the data importer2 The data importer agrees and warrants: (a) to process the personal data only on behalf of the data exporter and in compliance with its instructions and the Clauses; if it cannot provide such compliance for whatever reasons, it agrees to Mandatory requirements of the national legislation applicable to the data importer which do not go beyond what is necessary in a democratic society on the basis of one of the interests listed in Article 13(1) of Directive 95\/46\/EC, that is, if they constitute a necessary measure to safeguard national security, defense, public security, the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences or of breaches of ethics for the regulated professions, an important economic or financial interest of the State or the protection of the data subject or the rights and freedoms of others, are not in contradiction with the standard contractual clauses.

Clause 6 Liability 1. The parties agree that any data subject, who has suffered damage as a result of any breach of the obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11 by any party or subprocessor is entitled to receive compensation from the data exporter for the damage suffered. Page 172 of 182 DocuSign Envelope ID: 43A80C49-0788-4EF2-BBDA-E8BB4A0C13AA 2. If a data subject is not able to bring a claim for compensation in accordance with paragraph 1 against the data exporter, arising out of a breach by the data importer or his subprocessor of any of their obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11, because the data exporter has factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or has become insolvent, the data importer agrees that the data subject may issue a claim against the data importer as if it were the data exporter, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract of by operation of law, in which case the data subject can enforce its rights against such entity. The data importer may not rely on a breach by a subprocessor of its obligations in order to avoid its own liabilities. 3. If a data subject is not able to bring a claim against the data exporter or the data importer referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, arising out of a breach by the subprocessor of any of their obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11 because both the data exporter and the data importer have factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent, the subprocessor agrees that the data subject may issue a claim against the data subprocessor with regard to its own processing operations under the Clauses as if it were the data exporter or the data importer, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law, in which case the data subject can enforce its rights against such entity. The liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses. Clause 7 Mediation and jurisdiction 1. The data importer agrees that if the data subject invokes against it third-party beneficiary rights and\/or claims compensation for damages under the Clauses, the data importer will accept the decision of the data subject: (a) to refer the dispute to mediation, by an independent person or, where applicable, by the supervisory authority; (b) to refer the dispute to the courts in the Member State in which the data exporter is established. 2. The parties agree that the choice made by the data subject will not prejudice its substantive or procedural rights to seek remedies in accordance with other provisions of national or international law. Clause 8 Cooperation with supervisory authorities 1. The data exporter agrees to deposit a copy of this contract with the supervisory authority if it so requests or if such deposit is required under the applicable data protection law. 2. The parties agree that the supervisory authority has the right to conduct an audit of the data importer, and of any subprocessor, which has the same scope and is subject to the same conditions as would apply to an audit of the data exporter under the applicable data protection law. 3. The data importer shall promptly inform the data exporter about the existence of legislation applicable to it or any subprocessor preventing the conduct of an audit of the data importer, or any subprocessor, pursuant to paragraph 2. In such a case the data exporter shall be entitled to take the measures foreseen in Clause 5 (b). Page 173 of 182 DocuSign Envelope ID: 43A80C49-0788-4EF2-BBDA-E8BB4A0C13AA Clause 9 Governing Law The Clauses shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established. Clause 10 Variation of the contract The parties undertake not to vary or modify the Clauses. This does not preclude the parties from adding clauses on business related issues where required as long as they do not contradict the Clause. Clause 11 Subprocessing 1. The data importer shall not subcontract any of its processing operations performed on behalf of the data exporter under the Clauses without the prior written consent of the data exporter. Where the data importer subcontracts its obligations under the Clauses, with the consent of the data exporter, it shall do so only by way of a written agreement with the subprocessor which imposes the same obligations on the subprocessor as are imposed on the data importer under the Clauses3. Where the subprocessor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations under such written agreement the data importer shall remain fully liable to the data exporter for the performance of the subprocessor's obligations under such agreement. 2. The prior written contract between the data importer and the subprocessor shall also provide for a third- party beneficiary clause as laid down in Clause 3 for cases where the data subject is not able to bring the claim for compensation referred to in paragraph 1 of Clause 6 against the data exporter or the data importer because they have factually disappeared or have ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent and no successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law. Such third-party liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses. 3. The provisions relating to data protection aspects for subprocessing of the contract referred to in paragraph 1 shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established. 4. The data exporter shall keep a list of subprocessing agreements concluded under the Clauses and notified by the data importer pursuant to Clause 5 (j), which shall be updated at least once a year. The list shall be available to the data exporter's data protection supervisory authority. Clause 12 Obligation after the termination ofpersonal data processing services 1. The parties agree that on the termination of the provision of data processing services, the data importer and the subprocessor shall, at the choice of the data exporter, return all the personal data transferred and the copies thereof to the data exporter or shall destroy all the personal data and certify to the data exporter that it has done so, unless legislation imposed upon the data importer prevents it from returning This requirement may be satisfied by the sub-processor co-signing the contract entered into between the data exporter and the data importer under this Decision. Page 174 of 182 DocuSign Envelope ID: 43A80C49-0788-4EF2-BBDA-E8BB4A0C13AA or destroying all or part of the personal data transferred. In that case, the data importer warrants that it will guarantee the confidentiality of the personal data transferred and will not actively process the personal data transferred anymore. 2. The data importer and the subprocessor warrant that upon request of the data exporter and\/or of the supervisory authority, it will submit its data processing facilities for an audit of the measures referred to in paragraph 1.
