However, in the event the Customer terminates this Agreement within the Renewed Term, the foregoing 35% termination charges shall not be imposed, and the Security Deposit shall be reimbursed to the Customer. For the avoidance of doubt, if this Agreement is terminated by the Customer under Sections 7(b) (d) or (e), the Customer shall pay to PLDTSG all unpaid Service fees and charges for Services previously rendered, but shall otherwise have no further liability to PLDTSG. c) Upon termination or expiration of the Term and subject to Section 2(e), Customer shall remove from the Colocation Space and the Premises, at its sole cost, the Equipment, except fixtures, within fifteen (15) days from the date of such termination or expiration (the \"Removal Period’’).

Customer Support Group and\/or concerned Support Group Head\/engineer-in- charge 4. Customer Credits 4.1. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, if PLDTSG fails to meet the above Service Availability Targets during any Calendar Year, PLDTSG shall provide a credit to Customer (\"Customer Credit\"), which shall be deducted from Customer’s total annual charges (computed as Monthly Recurring Fee x 12 months) and shall be Customer's sole and exclusive remedy for PLDTSG's failure to satisfy the Service Availability guarantees specified herein. The Customer Credit for a particular year shall be equivalent to two percent (2%) of the total annual charges for every two (2) percentage points’ shortfall in Actual Service Availability from the Service Availability Target. Actual Service Availability shall be calculated as follows: Actaal Service AvaBaHity = - 1 ~ 525,600 nwiirs >xl00% 4.2. Upon resolution of the problem, with a final fix or a temporary work around, and closure of Trouble Ticket, Customer must contact PLDTSG HelpDesk within five (5) business days to request a Customer Credit and reference the Trouble Ticket assigned. Failure to comply with this requirement will forfeit Customer's right to receive a credit. Any Customer Credit determined to be due by HelpDesk shall be credited towards the next month’s charges from receipt of request for Customer Credit. 4.3. If PLDTSG fails to comply with more than one Guarantee at the same period of time with respect to a Customer during a Calendar Year, only the Guarantee producing the greatest measured Customer Credit to such Customer shall be considered for the granting of Customer Credit. 4.4. The maximum annual credit shall not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the Customer's total annual charges. In the event the Customer would receive credits in any given year equal to fifty percent (50%) of the total annual charges, Customer shall have the option to cancel service at the time without penalty. 4.5. Customer shall not be entitled to Customer Credits unless Customer has paid PLDTSG all amounts due and is otherwise in full compliance with its corresponding service agreement with PLDTSG (\"Service Agreement”). PLDTSG reserves the right to offset any Customer Credits owed to Customer against any amounts owed by Customer to PLDTSG. 4.6. Under NO circumstances shall Customer Credit be applied when: a) Customer is in breach, non-compliance or violation, of its Service Agreement during the Service Outage b) Service provided to the Customer is suspended due to accounts receivable policies c) Service is being modified per request of Customer d) Service is under Scheduled Maintenance 24 of 25 PLDTSG Colocation Agreement 5. Eligibility\/Applicability of SLA 5.1. This SLA applies only to Customers agreeing to a minimum service period of one (1) year in their Service Agreement. 5.2. Downtime shall not be deemed to occur and calculation of Service Outage shall not include any unavailability (outlined in Section 2) caused by or associated with, in whole or in part, the following events if applicable: a) security breaches including, but not limited to, denial of service attacks, network floods, hacking or other security lapse (e.g. computer virus attacks from external sources via internet) on the Customer’s systems, equipment and network, and mail \"bombs\" or mail \"spamming\" (unsolicited e-mails) on the Subscriber's servers; b) Customer's acts or omissions, including without limitation, any negligence, willful misconduct, or use of PLDTSG’s services, systems, equipment and\/or network in breach of Customer’s relevant Service Agreement; c) fortuitous events and force majeure (as defined in Section 3.4); d) inability of an PLDTSG staff to gain access to the Customer’s systems and\/or premises for the purpose of fault rectification due to the Customer; e) network unavailability outside IDC Network and Fiber Optic Link, including but not limited to: ■ failure of any third-party telecommunications services provider(s) (e.g. cutting a fiber line somewhere); • failure of access circuits to the IDC Network and Fiber Optic Link, unless such failure is caused solely by PLDTSG; • restrictions on accessing underground facilities for specified dates and time (e.g. manholes\/conduits) beyond PLDTSG’s reasonable control; ■ backbone peering point issues (e.g. having a router go down that wipes out internet service for the entire country) f) Emergency and Scheduled Maintenance\/Repairs and\/or upgrade activities; g) customer equipment, application and circuit malfunction and\/or failure PLDTSG reserves the right to modify or amend this SLA at any time, subject to thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to Customer and with the Customer’s prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Except as set forth in this SLA, PLDTSG makes no claims or warranties regarding Service Availability. Specific terms of this SLA may be adjusted on a case-to-case basis in accordance with the relevant Service Agreement for certain Customers. This SLA shall thus be interpreted in accordance with and is made expressly subject to the terms of the relevant Service Agreement. In case of inconsistency between the terms of this SLA and the Customer’s Service Agreement, the relevant terms of the Service Agreement shall prevail over this SLA. This SLA shall in no way be interpreted to amend or modify the terms of the Customer’s Service Agreement. 25 of 25 PLDTSG Colocation Agreement ","contract_name":"CW3461359","file_name":"PLDT_Colocation Agmt_0720.pdf"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-05-10T09:38:39.093221Z","updated_at":"2022-05-11T16:55:18.248861Z","project":2},{"id":34,"annotations":[{"id":15,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":179,"end":205,"text":"PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP","labels":["Metadata Fields - Parties - Counterparty Name"]},"id":"1gbWz0mpK2","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":0,"end":10,"text":"AMENDMENT ","labels":["Metadata Fields - Agreement Type"]},"id":"Hra9-mHnqh","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":61,"end":118,"text":"effective as of July 1,2021 (“Amendment Effective Date”),","labels":["Metadata Fields - Effective Date"]},"id":"wA-Gskn-SR","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":912,"end":925,"text":"June 30, 2022","labels":["Metadata Fields - Expiry Date (Date format)"]},"id":"AS1nUuvRNe","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":685,"end":978,"text":"otwithstanding the paragraph in the Engagement Letter entitled “Timeframe,” the term of the Engagement Letter shall be extended for one (1) Agreement Year (as defined in the Engagement Letter), for the period July 1,2021 until June 30, 2022, at which time the Engagement Letter will terminate.","labels":["Metadata Fields - Term Type"]},"id":"cyFVc_bTmW","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":2867,"end":2883,"text":"Totals $ 103,482","labels":["Metadata Fields - Total Contract Value"]},"id":"PvMpm-ftq3","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":137,"end":164,"text":"FIS Capital Markets US LLC ","labels":["Metadata Fields - Parties - Customer Legal Entity Name"]},"id":"3sW1a2OvyK","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-05-11T10:48:47.802742Z","updated_at":"2022-05-11T16:54:10.486334Z","lead_time":128118.672,"prediction":{"id":34,"model_version":"undefined","created_ago":"1 day, 1 hour","result":[{"from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","value":{"start":1870,"end":1889,"text":"Lawrence F.

Provider and FIS have entered into that certain Master Purchase Agreement dated October 1, 2017, as amended (the “Master Purchase Agreement”) which sets forth certain terms and conditions applicable to products and services provided from Provider to FIS. The terms and conditions of the Master Purchase Agreement are hereby incorporated into this PSA (defined below) by this reference. If the Parties amend the Master Purchase Agreement to change any of the terms and conditions of the Master Purchase Agreement, the terms and conditions as so amended shall be deemed incorporated into this Product and Service Addendum - Print and Mail Applications (“PSA”). The capitalized terms used but not defined in this PSA shall have the meaning assigned them in the Master Purchase Agreement. 2. PSA INITIAL TERM. This PSA shall be effective upon the Second Amendment Effective Date (“PSA Effective Date”) and shall remain in full force and effect thereafter until September 30, 2023 (the “PSA Initial Term”). Unless either party provides the other party with no less than sixty (60) days advance written notice of its intent to terminate this PSA prior to the end of the PSA Initial Term or any PSA Renewal Term, this PSA shall automatically renew for successive one (1) year terms (each a “PSA Renewal Term”), unless terminated sooner as provided herein. The PSA Initial Term and Renewal Term are referred to collectively as the “PSA Term”. In the event this PSA terminates prior to the expiration or termination of an SOW hereunder, this PSA shall continue to govern such SOW until such time as the SOW expires or is terminated in accordance with the terms and conditions in the Agreement or the SOW. 3. STATEMENTS OF WORK. The requirements for each print and mail application shall be set forth in a (i) Customer purchase order, (ii) job plan, (iii) statement of work, or (iv) other mutually agreed upon document (collectively referred to herein as, the “SOW”). The parties agree that each SOW shall be strictly subject to the terms and conditions of the Master Purchase Agreement and this PSA. RR Donnelley agrees to provide to Customer during the SOW term, and Customer agrees to purchase from RR Donnelley during the SOW term, those Products and Services set forth in a specific SOW. The SOW shall, at a minimum, contain: (i) a term, (ii) the contact names, phone numbers and email addresses for the key personnel of each party, (iii) a detailed description of the Products and Services, (iv) the specifications and requirements for the Products and Services, (v) any applicable service levels, if any, and (vi) pricing for the Products and Services. In the event of a conflict between the pricing, price adjustment or postage terms set forth in this PSA with the pricing, price adjustment or postage terms set forth in the SOW, the pricing, price adjustment or postage terms in the SOW shall control. Statement of Work #1 is attached hereto as Exhibit 1. 4. PRICE ADJUSTMENT. Unless otherwise set forth in the applicable SOW, the pricing set forth in each SOW shall be subject to adjustment based on the following: Materials: The prices for Products may be adjusted for changes in material prices based on the percent price change to RRD as documented by a mill letter (each an “Adjustment Date”). Each paper mill letter will indicate the effective date of the actual price change. Material cost will be deemed to be 50% of the Product’s total price (excluding freight). Services: The prices for Products may be adjusted based on the percent change in the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers (CPI-U) U.S. City Average for All Items published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the United States Department of Labor (1982-1984-100) (the “CPI”). “CPI Change” will be measured as the percentage increase from (1) the most recent CPI published value available in the month prior to the adjustment date, and (2) the SOW Effective Date, or the last Adjustment Date, whichever occurred last. Labor cost will be deemed to be 50% of the Product’s total price (excluding freight). Example (Assumed): Current Price is $100 Mill Letter increase is 5% CPI increase is 2% Material % is 50% Labor % is 50% New Price = $100 x ((5% x 50%) + (2% x 50%) + 1) = $103.50 Presort. If a USPS rate change results in an increase to the spread between the 5-digit Automation Letter rate and the ADC Automation Letter rate, then the rate RRD bills to Customer for presort services will be adjusted. This adjustment will be calculated as 60% of the change to the spread. Confidential Page 2 of 5 If a USPS rate change results in a decrease to the spread between the 5-digit Automation Letter rate and the ADC Automation Letter rate, then the rate RRD bills to Customer for presort services will be adjusted. This adjustment will be calculated as 60% of the change to the spread. 5. POSTAGE. Unless otherwise set forth in a SOW, For the payment of postage costs hereunder, Customer shall: (a) Establish and properly fund a Centralized Account Processing System (CAPS) account, or its successor, Enterprise Payment System (“EPS”) account, collectively known as “CAPS\/EPS” herein, directly with the United States Postal Service (the “USPS”). Customer acknowledges that postage is not included in the price, and that RR Donnelley has no responsibility or liability whatsoever for Customer’s postage costs. In the event a Customer mailing is delayed by the USPS as a result of insufficient postage in Customer’s CAPS\/EPS account, RR Donnelley shall have no liability whatsoever, including, but not limited to, compliance with associated service levels and\/or payment of associated service level credits. In the event circumstances arise in which Customer is required to provide postage directly to RR Donnelley for metered mail pieces, damaged mail pieces, or foreign mail pieces, for example, Customer agrees to (a) provide RR Donnelley with a check made payable to the U.S. Postmaster (except in the event of metered mail or live stamps such check shall be made payable to RR Donnelley), or (b) send via wire transfer \/ ACH to a designated RR Donnelley postage account the required postage no later than ten (10) days prior to the scheduled mail date.

Unless otherwise requested by Customer, any postage surplus shall remain in the RR Donnelley postage account and applied to subsequent Customer mailings. If no subsequent Customer mailings are anticipated by Customer, RR Donnelley shall issue a check to Customer for the surplus postage. In the event of a postage deficiency, RR Donnelley shall immediately notify Customer of such deficiency, and Customer shall make prompt payment to RR Donnelley for the required amount(s). RR Donnelley reserves the right to delay a scheduled mail date, without liability, for insufficient postage. (b) If reasonably requested by RR Donnelley, Customer shall provide RR Donnelley with the proper USPS forms and\/or documentation (in an executed format if required), or some other mutually agreed upon form and\/or documentation, to confirm and support the USPS documents prepared by RR Donnelley on behalf of Customer in performing the mailing services (e.g., Move Update). 6. CUSTOMER DATA. (a) All production and test data furnished by Customer shall remain the property of Customer, and be submitted in the format established by the parties in the applicable SOW. RR Donnelley shall not be responsible for any data furnished by Customer that is defective, accidentally erased, corrupt or otherwise unusable by Customer as a result of the acts or omissions of Customer or for any costs associated with the acts or omissions of Customer, such as duplicating or recreating images, recreating a photo¬ shoot, reprinting or redistributing material that has been printed or bound using defective data or any similar expenses.

The integration certificate is valid worldwide for the duration indicated on the integration certificate. 4.3 SAP will decide which employees to use and reserves the right to replace any employee at any time. SAP may use contractors or third parties to perform its duties in the Certification Contract SAP Integration Certification Center Software General Terms and Conditions enGLOBAL.v.5-2019 Page 2 of 14 DocuSign Envelope ID: 90571DB5-F469-4564-8334-44E83A03D517 as long as they are subject to confidentiality obligations. SAP shall be responsible for the actions of any contractors and third parties used by SAP under this Certification Contract. 4.4 Any trial or evaluation use of the SAP Software shall be provided pursuant to a separate SAP Trial Agreement to be entered into between the parties separate from the Certification Contract. 5. VENDOR'S CONTRIBUTIONS 5.1 In all phases and for all actions under this Certification Contract, a reasonable cooperation of Vendor is required. Vendor must provide free of charge all reasonable contributions as required in connection with performance of its obligations under the Certification Contract, including but not limited to providing necessary personnel, workspace, hardware, software, data, and telecommunications facilities, answering questions, and evaluating SAP's deliverables. To the extent required for performance under the Certification Contract, Vendor shall grant SAP direct and remote access to Vendor's hardware and software. 5.2 Vendor must nominate in writing a suitable contact person for SAP (and qualified subproject leads, if beneficial for the collaboration), and provide SAP with the contact data (including but not limited to an e-mail address and telephone number) at which SAP can reach each such person or an authorized substitute at all times. The contact person must be in a position to make necessary decisions for Vendor or ensure that they are made without delay. Vendor must inform SAP of all changes to the contact details in writing without delay. 5.3 Vendor is responsible for adapting the Vendor Solution in accordance with the technical and functional requirements of the Integration Scenario and the underlying specific SAP documentation. Vendor must provide all information reasonably requested by SAP concerning the Vendor Solution and its technical usage scenario in connection with SAP Software and the corresponding SAP Interface. 5.4 SAP will determine the place and mode of the certification testing, which may be provided either by tests using Internet collaboration tools or on-site. Vendor shall ensure at its own expense that the Vendor Solution as well as all software, documentation, resources, and\/or materials required for integration certification testing from Vendor are ready and accessible. Alternatively to conducting the certification testing at SAP's facilities, the test may be conducted at a location specified by the Vendor, if agreed to in advance by SAP in writing. In such a case, Vendor shall pay for all travel and subsistence costs and expenses for the SAP personnel involved. In case hardware and software of Vendor is shipped to SAP tests, it is the responsibility of the Vendor to remove the hardware from SAP at the certification location after certification. SAP will not be responsible for shipment and return of the hardware or the associated costs. 5.5 Certification services are not provided for custom-tailored or individual solutions, but only for standard solutions generally available in the market. Upon SAP's request, Vendor will provide evidence that the Vendor Solution is a generally available product and not a custom-tailored solution or developed for a specific customer. 5.6 Vendor must promptly notify SAP of any change in the circumstances on which the Certification Contract or the certification services are based on, including but not limited to the fact that (i) the Vendor Solution is no longer generally available or (ii) the Vendor Solution is technically modified (in a way that impacts the Integration Scenario), or (iii) the name of Vendor or of the Vendor Solution is changed, or (iv) change of any software component and\/or configuration of the Vendor Solution. In such cases the Vendor Solution may either be no longer eligible for certification or has to be re-certified according to § 7. 5.7 With the successful certification as described under § 6, Vendor hereby consents, that SAP may include Vendor's name, address and company logo, as well as information provided by the Vendor relating to the tested Vendor Solution in a reference list on the respective SAP Web site, as well as in collateral and advertising material relating to integration certification. All use of Vendor's name will be in accordance with Vendor's published TM guidelines provided by Vendor directly to SAP at the time of certification. SAP may change the contents or restructure SAP Integration Certification Center Software General Terms and Conditions enGLOBAL.v.5-2019 Page 3 of 14 DocuSign Envelope ID: 90571DB5-F469-4564-8334-44E83A03D517 its Web site in its sole discretion, including but not limited to the materials on integration certification. In addition, SAP may provide any of its licensees and prospective customers that requests information about the Vendor Solution with the information provided by Vendor (for example, product description and contact details) for that purpose. Vendor may revoke SAP's right to use Vendor's data as provided under this subsection 7 upon thirty (30) days prior written notice. In this case, SAP is entitled to terminate the Certification Contract with immediate effect. 5.8 Vendor must bear all costs and expenses arising out of its breach of its collaborative obligations under this § 5 or elsewhere in the Certification Contract. Vendor is obligated to pay any agreed upon fees in case of SAP's non-performance pursuant to Vendor's failure to perform or properly perform its obligations under the Certification Contract. 6. INTEGRATION CERTIFICATION 6.1 The Integration Scenario applicable to the certification is described in the Certification Contract. The successfully concluded Integration certification implies that the Vendor Solution meets the specifications defined in the documentation of the Integration Scenario and has been successfully tested by SAP against them. SAP's technical integration certification however does not guarantee fault-free operation of the Vendor Solution nor may Vendor make any statement whatsoever with respect to any connection of the legal compliance of the Vendor Solution with the integration certification provided hereunder. Vendor must not make any representation or declaration in that regard. The payment of the Estimated Service Fees under the applicable Service Offer does not guarantee the successful granting of the Certification of the Vendor Solution. 6.2 SAP reserves the right to determine the sequence of integration certification in the case of multiple applications of different vendors. 6.3 Upon Vendor's successful completion of the certification, during the term of the Certification Contract, SAP will issue an acknowledgement in electronic format to Vendor in the form of an SAP integration certificate. The integration certificate is valid worldwide and may be used for marketing as such also by Vendor's Affiliates, subject to Vendor ensuring the proper use of the integration certificate according to these GTCs by the Affiliate. SAP grants Vendor the right to use the integration certificate and the statement contained therein solely for the version of the Vendor Solution stated in the integration certificate in relation to the specially certified Integration Scenario and solely in connection with the special version of the SAP Software for advertising and promotion purposes. The entitlement to use a specific integration certificate expires after the term stated on the certificate itself, or when any of the tested software components are no longer in maintenance by Vendor. Vendor may then no longer use the integration certificate in its communication with its clients or other third parties. The SAP tagline or SAP logo(s) described in the Certification Contract are to be used in accordance with Annex 1 to these GTCs and SAP's then current trademark license terms and any of the respective usage guidelines. SAP is entitled to terminate the Certification Contract with immediate effect if Vendor breaches this § 6 (3). 6.4 Without prior written consent from SAP, Vendor is not permitted to render or provide any information concerning SAP software license terms, SAP Software, SAP Interface or any other information related to SAP products, except as expressly stated in the Certification Contract. Vendor shall refer any customer requiring such information to SAP. Vendor agrees to obtain SAP's prior written consent of all statements regarding SAP itself, SAP software and SAP services in conjunction with the subject matter of the Certification Contract. Vendor is entitled to repeat its use of a statement after such statement has been initially approved by SAP. However, if the content of such an approved statement remains no longer true because of major changes, SAP may withdraw its approval. 6.5 Unless otherwise stated in the Certification Contract, Vendor must complete the integration certification process for the Vendor Solution within nine (9) months after effective date of the SAP Integration Certification Center Software General Terms and Conditions enGLOBAL.v.5-2019 Page 4 of 14 DocuSign Envelope ID: 90571DB5-F469-4564-8334-44E83A03D517 Certification Contract, and in case of annual subscriptions within each subsequent Renewal Term. If Vendor fails to do so, the integration certification fee shall not be refunded. 7. RE-CERTIFICATION 7.1 Vendor is entitled to use the integration certificate as well as the logo(s) and other rights granted in the Certification Contract only in connection with the version of the Vendor Solution tested during the integration certification process and the particular version of the SAP Interface and Integration Scenario respectively. To use the certification statement with further versions, a new integration certification process (\"Re-certification\") is required. In the following cases, Vendor must trigger a Re-certification to continue using the certification statement and other rights granted in the Certification Contract for an existing already certified Vendor Solution: (a) Modifications of the SAP Interface or change to a SAP Interface version (b) Modifications or enhancements to the tested Vendor Solution that affect the Integration Scenario and\/or impede an exchange of data with the SAP Interface (c) Modifications of any software component and\/or configuration as tested (d) Change of the name or the labeling of the Vendor Solution (e) Change to Vendor's company name (f) Expiration of the validity indicated on the integration certificate. 7.2 SAP will use commercially reasonable efforts to give notification of any modification to SAP Software affecting the Integration Scenario within a reasonable period soon after it is generally released to SAP customers, and to provide to Vendor the relevant documentation for any release changes of the SAP Software related to the Integration Scenario by the release date. 7.3 There is no obligation on the part of SAP to offer a Re-certification for any particular Integration Scenario. SAP provides consulting and certification test services for such a Re-certification at SAP's then current terms and conditions. Any additional effort required from SAP beyond these services will be invoiced at SAP's then current consulting rates. Necessary or agreed upon travel and subsistence expenses will also be charged on Vendor's account. 8. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 8.1 Upon execution of the Service Offer, SAP grants to Vendor, for the term of the Certification Contract as set forth under § 14 (1), a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable right to use the technical SAP documentation, SAP Sample Code, or other SAP Confidential Information provided by SAP to Vendor under the Certification Contract solely for testing purposes and solely in connection with the certification process described in the Certification Contract. 8.2 Vendor acknowledges that all Intellectual Property Rights in the SAP Software, SAP Interface, the SAP Confidential Information, the SAP Sample Code, and any materials supplied hereunder including, but not limited to, all documentation relating to the Integration Scenario and\/or the relevant test plan \/ Certification Guide, are and shall remain vested exclusively in SAP.

Neither party shall acquire any rights in the trademarks of the other party except if it is otherwise expressly provided under the Certification Contract. All use of SAP trademarks shall be in accordance with these GTCs and the applicable Annexes. 9. SUPPORT 9.1 Vendor ensures that it can provide an adequate number of employees with the appropriate knowledge, trainings and background knowledge to provide appropriate consulting and consulting support. These may become necessary to enable the use of the Vendor Solution in conjunction with the SAP Software, including version management and the necessary support for a customer migration. 9.2 If there is an increasing number of requests for support and service from joint customers, SAP may require further special test of the Vendor Solution in conjunction with the SAP Software and the SAP Interface. These tests are performed at designated SAP's facilities, unless otherwise expressly agreed. Vendor will install the Vendor Solution as well as all related and necessary soft- and hardware components and will provide personnel necessary for the tests free of charge. 10.

If no fixed price is agreed billing will be on a resource-related basis listing the provided works and services in the invoice. 11. LIMITED WARRANTY; INDEMNITY 11.1 SAP warrants that its services will be performed in a professional and workmanlike manner. This warranty shall be in effect for thirty (30) days from performance of the services. Any deficiencies in the services must be reported in writing within thirty (30) days of completion of such services. Provided SAP validates the existence of such warrant breach, SAP will at its sole option either re-perform the services or refund the fees paid for the applicable services. This is Vendor’s sole and exclusive remedy for a warranty breach. EXCEPT FOR THE FOREGOING EXPRESS LIMITED WARRANTY, AND TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, SAP AND ITS LICENSORS DO NOT MAKE, AND VENDOR DOES NOT RECEIVE, ANY WARRANTIES REPRESENTATIONS OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE RELATED TO OR ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE CERTIFICATION CONTRACT OR THE PROVISION OF SERVICES THEREUNDER. SAP SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, NON- SAP Integration Certification Center Software General Terms and Conditions enGLOBAL.v.5-2019 Page 6 of 14 DocuSign Envelope ID: 90571DB5-F469-4564-8334-44E83A03D517 INFRINGEMENT, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. ANY CLAIM OF VENDOR FOR COMPENSATION OF COSTS OR DAMAGES IS EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED. 11.2 In case of any defects, Vendor shall immediately notify SAP in writing identifying any defects and giving a precise description of the problem and appropriate information for eliminating such defect. 11.3 Vendor shall be solely responsible for and will defend and indemnify SAP, SAP's affiliated companies and SAP's representatives, officers, employees, directors and agents (\"SAP Indemnitees”) against any third party claims based on (i) any negligence, misrepresentation, or errors or omissions on the part of Vendor or its representatives in their use of any Certification provided under this Certification Contract; and (ii) infringement of a third party's Intellectual property rights. Vendor will indemnify SAP from a finally awarded judgment (including attorney's fees), against SAP Indemnitees for the third-party claim by a court of competent jurisdiction or pursuant to an authorized settlement agreement applicable to such third-party claim.

EACH PARTY'S LIABILITY IS CUMULATIVE; WITH ALL OF THE CLAIMING PARTY'S LOSSES BEING AGGREGATED TO DETERMINE SATISFACTION OF THE LIMIT. The provisions of the Certification Contract allocate risks between SAP and Vendor. The service fees reflect the allocation of risk and the limitations of liability herein. 13. CONFIDENTIALITY AND DATA PROTECTION 13.1 Each party of the Certification Contract has the duty to keep strictly secret the Confidential Information of the other party, and not to disclose such information except to employees and contractors, under a contractual obligation of confidentiality, who have a legitimate need to know such information. In addition, except as expressly provided in this Certification Contract, Vendor does not have the right to use the Confidential Information in any manner for any purposes other than for the fulfilment of executed Service Orders, or as necessary for the Vendor to exercise its limited right to use the SAP Confidential Information pursuant to § 8. The duties of confidentiality and non-use shall survive the expiration or termination of the Certification Contract. Notwithstanding the foregoing, SAP shall be permitted to internally use Vendor's Confidential Information disclosed under the Certification Contract as well as any certification results and data for SAP's business purposes including by SAP's support and SAP Integration Certification Center Software General Terms and Conditions enGLOBAL.v.5-2019 Page 7 of 14 DocuSign Envelope ID: 90571DB5-F469-4564-8334-44E83A03D517 maintenance organization(s) and contractors under an obligation of confidentiality as defined in § 13 (1). 13.2 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, \"Confidential Information” shall not include any information that, without restrictions of confidentiality or any breach thereof: (i) was known to the other party prior to the disclosure by the disclosing party; (ii) is or becomes publicly known without the fault of the receiving party; (iii) is obtained by the receiving party from a third party; or (iv) is developed independently by the receiving party without reference to any other Confidential Information.

TUPE 17.1 The Supplier agrees to arrange Personnel in relation to the Services in such a way that no individual at any time (a) forms part of an organised grouping of employees which has as its principal purpose the provision of the Services or (b) no Personnel is\/are wholly or mainly assigned to the provision of the Services. 17.2 The parties agree and acknowledge that on the expiry of this Agreement, an SOW or at the cessation of any Services being provided by the Supplier (referred to as the \"End Date” for the purposes of this Agreement), the parties do not intend that any of the employees of either Party or their respective subcontractors will transfer to the other under the provisions of the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 (SI 2006\/246) as amended or replaced or any other regulations implementing the Acquired Rights Directive (\"TUPE\"). 17.3 If any Personnel who were employed or otherwise engaged immediately prior to the End Date (\"Affected Employee\") should claim to be employed by Worldpay or a replacement supplier to Worldpay as a result of the provisions of TUPE applying in relation to this Agreement or an SOW then Worldpay shall, upon becoming aware of such claim, notify the Supplier in writing within fourteen (14) days and allow the Supplier the period of twenty eight (28) days from receipt of such notification either to offer employment to that person or take other steps with a view to obtaining a written withdrawal of that person's claim to be employed by Worldpay or a replacement supplier. 17.4 If the Affected Employee accepts employment with the Supplier, Worldpay shall immediately release that person from its employment or alleged employment. 17.5 The Supplier shall: (a) remain responsible throughout the period between the End Date and either the date of withdrawal of the Affected Employee's claim or the Supplier's release (per clause 17.4) for the payment of all salary and benefits to that person; and (b) indemnify Worldpay against all Employee Liabilities arising out of or in connection with non-payment of the same. 17.6 If the Affected Employee's claim that they are employed by Worldpay or a replacement supplier is not withdrawn or resolved within twenty eight (28) days of the Supplier being notified, Worldpay or the replacement supplier may terminate the Affected Employee's employment within fourteen (14) days of the twenty eight (28) Business Day period expiring. In such circumstances, the Supplier shall indemnify Worldpay against all Employee Liabilities arising out of or in connection with: (i) any claim or other legal recourse brought by the Affected Employee in respect of any fact or matter concerning or arising from their employment with the Supplier or its subcontractor and\/or their transfer to Worldpay or a replacement supplier; (ii) such person's salary and benefits; and (iii) the termination of the employment of such Affected Employee for whatever reason but excluding any Employee Liabilities arising out of or in connection with any claim of discrimination in respect of the act of termination itself by Worldpay or a replacement supplier, any failure on Worldpay's or a replacement supplier's part to follow any statutory minimum dismissal procedures or the payment by Worldpay or a replacement supplier of any ex gratia sum or settlement which is not approved in writing in advance by the Supplier (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 17.7 In the event that TUPE applies to any Personnel, the Supplier shall indemnify Worldpay, its officers and\/or directors against all Losses suffered or incurred by Worldpay, its officers and\/or directors arising out of or in connection with Worldpay's compliance with TUPE or any failure by the Supplier, its subcontractors and\/or Personnel to comply with TUPE in relation to their employees and\/or the transfer of such employees. 17.8 Both parties shall comply with Regulation 13 of TUPE in so far as TUPE applies to that Party and shall share information with each other and any replacement suppliers to enable each Party to comply with the same. 18.

Worldpay warrants and represents that it will (at the Supplier's reasonable expense) execute all such documents and carry out all such acts, as reasonably required to give effect to this clause 19.9. Worldpay may at any time assign, transfer, novate or subcontract any or all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to any Group Company or any third party provided that Worldpay can demonstrate that such third party is an economic entity of reasonable financial standing and that such assignment or novation does not increase the risk or cost to the Supplier in respect of the Services. 19.9 Continuing obligations - Where the Supplier has sub-contracted any of the Services, the Supplier will remain liable to Worldpay for the acts or omissions of its subcontractors. 19.10 Entire Agreement - This Agreement constitutes the whole agreement between the Parties, and replaces and extinguishes all previous agreements, undertakings, or collateral contracts of any nature made by the parties, whether oral or written, in relation to its subject matter.

VM'Month 1 4.2. The Services shall meet the following Requirements: (i) The provided hosting is segregated into several functional groups with a central shared administration layer. Each of the functional server groups is separated into its own VLAN, and all communications between VLANs are blocked, with the exception of rules specified by Worldpay. (ii) Each solution is comprised of a virtualised primary and secondary environment hosted on the Supplier's infrastructure within third party Tier 3 datacentres. The primary environment is hosted within the Teledata Manchester datacentre and the secondary environment within the AQL Leeds datacentre. Both environments are subject to automated 24x7 monitoring with alerts being emailed to both the Supplier and nominated email account(s) of Worldpay. 30 (iii) The primary environments are intended to be active by default with the secondary environments acting as a fail-over environment to be used in the event of outages or planned maintenance or other service failures relating to the respective primary environments. (iv) The primary environments are hosted on a highly resilient hardware infrastructure running VMware vSphere. The hardware infrastructure benefits from both Internet connectivity and power redundancy. (v) In the case of Internet connectivity, resiliency is provided by two diverse routes through separate datacentre hardware routers synchronised using Cisco Hot Standby Router Protocol or HSRP. Each router is connected to one of the the Supplier's Dell SonicWALL firewalls, themselves clustered in a statefully-synchronised active\/passive High Availability (HA) pair. (vi) In the case of power redundancy, resiliency is provided by two diversely- cabled connections to independent datacentre power distribution boards. Each power distribution board is fed by its own independent power supply and benefits from its own N + 1 Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) battery infrastructure and diesel generator. Each power feed to the Supplier's infrastructure is connected to separate primary APC Power Distribution Units (PDU) with all critical hardware components featuring dual Power Supply Units (PSU) connected to both PDUs. Critical hardware components with only a single PSU are connected to secondary active\/passive dual-feed APC PDUs which are powered by two of the primary PDUs. (vii) The secondary environment, whilst still benefitting from the resiliency typical of datacentre-hosted infrastructures, is more limited in its levels of Internet connectivity and power redundancy given its application only in the event of issues with the primary infrastructure. A single Internet connection, firewall and power feed therefore provide Internet connectivity and power. (viii) Both the primary and secondary environment are hosted on a Supermicro hyperconverged infrastructure using VMware VSAN storage. The Supermicro servers are covered by hardware warranties with four hour on-site response times and storage is deployed in resilient N + 1 configuration. (ix) The primary and secondary environments are synchronised over the Supplier's fibre link between the two datacentres using a Microsoft Active Directory replication, Microsoft DFS Replication, and SQL Server Always On Availability Groups. (x) In addition to the ongoing synchronisation process, the primary environment for both entities is also subject to the Supplier's standard nightly Veeam VPS backup process which stores backups on-site within the Teledata Manchester datacentre and operates with a thirty-day retention window. The Supplier also replicates the Veeam VPS backups to the secondary datacentre giving four layers of data protection as follows: (A) Primary (Teledata Manchester) Datacentre 1) Production data on primary (active) environment. 2) Nightly Veeam backup of primary environment within primary datacentre. (B) Secondary (AQL Leeds) Datacentre 3) Near-real-time replica of production data on secondary (passive) environment. 31 4) Nightly copy of Veeam production data backup to secondary datacentre. (xi) Veeam backup status notifications are automatically sent to the Supplier's support team and can optionally also be sent to nominated WorldPay email accounts on request. (xii) The Veeam production data backups can support replication of the backups to a (reasonable) WorldPay location, subject to the availability of sufficient bandwidth and suitable target infrastructure including but not limited to a Veeam proxy server and appropriate data storage. (xiii) A DNS fail-over mechanism is used to switch between the primary and secondary environments with that process controlled by Worldpay for their respective environments since the Supplier has no access to Worldpay's DNS records. Worldpay recognises that DNS record replication across the Internet can cause delays in users being pointed to the active (primary or secondary) environment in the event of a DNS update being performed. (xiv) The Supplier's responsibilities as regards infrastructure maintenance and support are solely limited to the Resilient Web Hosting Environment Service. For the avoidance of any doubt maintenance and support services provided under this SOW do not extend to any other projects, services or agreements which may exist between the parties from time to time. Support in respect of such other projects, services or agreements will be subject to a separate SOW. (xv) The cost of 1 day (\"Timebank\") for the provision of Resilient Web Hosting Environment Service Maintenance and Support by The Supplier is included the Monthly service Fee referred to below. (xvi) Activities by The Supplier relating to the Supplier's general infrastructure underpinning the Resilient Web Hosting Environment Service, including but not limited to hardware maintenance and upgrades, upgrades to the virtualisation platform and monitoring solution maintenance, will not consume Timebank time and are not subject to an additional charge except in the event that the upgrades are specifically requested by Worldpay. (xvii) Worldpay will undertake periodic updates to the VPS's operating systems, applications as well as the firmware of the KEMP load balancer virtual appliances. Where reasonably required, the Supplier will assist Worldpay with this work on request by Worldpay through the Supplier's Timebank support arrangement. (xviii) Other than as described in this section, responsibility for Worldpay's Content and software run on the Resilient Web Hosting Environment Service is the sole responsibility of Worldpay. (xix) Worldpay will conduct periodic disaster recovery testing of both the Veeam VPS backups and the primary\/secondary datacentre fail-over mechanism; The Supplier will provide all reasonably necessary support to Worldpay in this endeavour. The Supplier's support will include: (A) restoring and booting VPS backups; (B) taking ‘snapshots' of VPS's; 32 (C) configuring datacentre firewalls; and (D) configuring datacentre networking. (xx) The Supplier's time spent on disaster recovery testing will be consumed from Worldpay's Timebank. 4.3. Worldpay acknowledges that it has no right, title or interest in the IP address allocated to it, and that any IP address allocated to Worldpay is allocated as part of the Services and is not portable or otherwise transferable by Worldpay in any manner whatsoever. 4.4. The Supplier shall promptly inform Worldpay of the IP address(es) that have been allocated to Worldpay and shall not renumber or reallocate such IP address(es) without giving Worldpay at least 48 hours' prior written notice. If an IP address is renumbered or reallocated by the Supplier, the Supplier shall use his reasonable endeavours to avoid any disruption to Worldpay. 4.5. Worldpay agrees that it will have no right, title or interest to the IP address upon termination of the relevant SOW, and that the acquisition by Worldpay of a new IP address for the hosted website or application (the \"Hosted Application”) following termination of this agreement shall be the exclusive responsibility of Worldpay. 4.6. Upon completion of the Term, this SOW shall remain in force as outlined at 2.2 above, but can be altered by Worldpay in the following cases: (a) Worldpay can increase or reduce the number of virtual servers that it requires by giving no less than one month's written notice to the Supplier. 4.7. Licence terms (a) The Software is to be used for: hosting of Worldpay websites and web services (b) The hosted infrastructure is expressly intended for the hosting of web applications, including but not limited to DNN Evoq Content. (c) The following restrictions on, and requirements for, use of the Software apply: (i) All third-party software licencing terms for applications installed on the server must be adhered to at all times. 4.8. Content and data (a) Worldpay shall not distribute or store in the Content on the Hosted Application any material or other information that: (i) infringes any Intellectual Property Rights; (ii) is in breach of any law, statute, or regulation including data protection legislation; (iii) is defamatory, libellous, racist, unlawfully threatening or harassing; (iv) is obscene, pornographic or indecent; (v) contains any viruses or other computer programs intended to damage, detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept or expropriate any personal information; or (vi) is, in the case of distribution, not solicited. 33 (b) Worldpay shall not allow the Hosted Application to be used for the purpose of gambling or any activity which could be found to constitute gambling. (c) For the avoidance of doubt, the Supplier does not monitor, and will have no liability for the contents of any communications (except for its own content and communications, if any) transmitted by virtue of the Services. (d) It shall be the sole responsibility of Worldpay to deal with any complaints, claims or other issues arising in respect of any communications transmitted and\/or any content contained on the Hosted Application in breach of this clause. The Supplier will use reasonable endeavours to forward to Worldpay any complaint, claim or other correspondence that it receives relating to a breach of this clause and Wroldpay shall respond to the same within a reasonable period of time so as to avoid any complaint, claim or other proceedings being threatened or brought against the Supplier. Worldpay hereby indemnifies the Supplier in respect of any complaint, award, judgment or other finding against it and\/or any costs or other expenses that it may suffer as a result of any complaint, claim, proposed claim or other proceedings being threatened or instigated for breach of this clause. Notwithstanding receipt of payment from Worldpay under the aforementioned indemnity the Supplier reserves its rights to pursue Worldpay for damages or any other remedy that it sees fit should breach of this clause occur. (e) The Supplier shall have the right immediately and where appropriate without notice to suspend or terminate the Services should breach of this clause have occurred or an allegation of such breach supported by sufficient evidence to allow the Supplier reasonably to conclude that breach has occurred, provided that the Supplier shall, where it is able, promptly on request provide the Worldpay with details of all allegations and copies of the evidence relating to this clause 4.8(e). (f) Worldpay grants to the Supplier a non-exclusive, royalty-free licence, during the term of this Agreement, to use, store and maintain the Content on a server for the purposes of providing the Services in accordance with this Agreement. The Supplier may make such copies as may be necessary to perform its obligations under this Agreement and the applicable SOW, including backup copies of the Content but the Supplier shall not be obliged to do so unless it has been expressly agreed that back up services will be provided. Upon the termination or expiration of this agreement, the Supplier shall destroy or deliver to Worldpay all such copies of the Content and other materials provided by Worldpay as and when requested by Worldpay. (g) This Agreement does not transfer or grant to the Supplier any right, title, interest or intellectual property rights in the Content, except for the rights expressly granted in this SOW. 4.9. Migration services (a) On the expiration or termination of the relevant SOW for any reason Worldpay may request the Supplier to provide the Migration Services to Worldpay, or to a third party service provider identified by Worldpay. The Supplier may charge for the Migration Services at its prices for such services current at that date. (b) Where Worldpay requests the Migration Services in accordance with paragraph 4.9(a), the Supplier shall promptly: (i) deliver Worldpay's Software and the Content to Worldpay, or to any successor internet service provider at addresses and locations designated by Worldpay; 34 (ii) where applicable, provide reasonable assistance to Worldpay to update its DNS tables to reflect the new IP addresses corresponding to the Hosted Application URLs as soon as reasonably practicable following receipt of notice from the successor ISP that it has established a DNS for the Hosted Application URLs; and (iii) where applicable, provide reasonable assistance to Worldpay to continue to provide a DNS for the Hosted Application URLs for a period of 30 days following the date of expiry or termination of the relevant SOW. (c) Worldpay shall be deemed to have accepted the Migration Services on the expiry of 60 days after delivery of the Content and Worldpay Software and the Visitor Information to Worldpay or its nominee as provided for in this Agreement or on notice of acceptance to the Supplier whichever is the earlier. On such acceptance the Supplier shall not be obliged to provide any further Migration Services to Worldpay. 4.10. The Services and Deliverables are provided \"as is” without any warranty. 5.

Unless otherwise required by Law, the Supplier shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, return or if Worldpay so elects, destroy (and in the case of destruction, certify that such destruction has taken place), all Personal Data upon any of the following: (a) at Worldpay's request; (b) the termination or expiration of this Agreement or the relevant SOW; or (c) when the Personal Data is no longer required by the Supplier for the provision of the Services. 3. The Supplier shall comply at all times with the Data Protection Legislation and shall not perform any of its obligations under this Agreement or any SOW in such a way as to cause Worldpay to breach any of its applicable obligations under the relevant Data Protection Legislation. 4. The Supplier shall not use any Worldpay Data for any purpose other than the rendering of Services to Worldpay and shall not disclose the Worldpay Data to any third parties or commercially exploit the Worldpay Data. The Supplier shall and shall procure that its Personnel shall not attempt to access or allow access to Worldpay Data to which they are not entitled or that is not required for the performance of the Services. 63 5. To the extent that the Supplier processes any Personal Data on behalf of Worldpay, the Supplier acknowledges that it is the Data Processor in relation to such data and shall procure that its Personnel shall: (a) obtain prior written consent from Worldpay in order to transfer the Personal Data to any sub-contractors or third parties for the provision of the Services; (b) Process the Personal Data strictly in accordance with instructions from Worldpay or the terms of this Agreement and then only to the extent, and in such manner, as is necessary for the provision of the Services, or as is required by Law or any Regulatory Authority; (c) ensure that only the Personnel shall have access to the Personal Data and are under an appropriate duty of confidentiality at least equivalent to those set out in clause 9; (d) implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to safeguard against unauthorised Processing (including accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to or alteration of, Personal Data transmitted, stored or otherwise Processed); (e) not process Personal Data in a public place or any location where such Personal Data may be viewed by others, including in waiting areas, on public transport or across unencrypted public networks; (f) promptly refer to Worldpay (and at the latest within two (2) Business Days) any queries relating to Personal Data Processed on behalf of Worldpay from Data Subjects, any information commissioner or any other Regulatory Authority, which Worldpay may decide to resolve at its discretion, and at Worldpay's cost (the Supplier shall only pass on such costs as are reasonably incurred), promptly provide such information to Worldpay as Worldpay may reasonably require to allow it to comply with the rights of the Data Subjects, including subject access rights, or information notices or queries requested by a Regulatory Authority; (g) promptly carry out (at Worldpay's expense) any request from Worldpay requiring the Supplier to amend, transfer or delete the Personal Data or any part of the Personal Data; (h) provide to Worldpay on request such information as may be reasonably requested by Worldpay regarding the steps the Supplier has taken to comply with its obligations under this Schedule 7 Part A and the Data Protection Legislation including, without prejudice to Worldpay's rights under clause 6, submitting to audits, including inspections, conducted by Worldpay or a third party auditor mandated by Worldpay the Supplier's cost of assisting with such audits to be borne by Worldpay; (i) not process or otherwise transfer any Personal Data outside the European Economic Area or USA (whichever is the Processing location with respect to the applicable SOW under which the Personal Data is Processed) without Worldpay's express prior written consent and if such consent is provided, shall only process or otherwise transfer such Personal Data on terms that comply with applicable Data Protection Legislation (insofar as it relates to Worldpay as Data Controller) and in accordance with a cross border data transfer mechanism, EEA Standard Contractual Clauses for the transfer of Personal Data to Processors established in third countries and\/or Binding Corporate Rules. The Supplier must immediately notify Worldpay if the Supplier ceases to, or makes a determination that the Supplier can no longer meet this requirement, and will promptly take all necessary steps to remedy the non-compliance. A breach of this provision will be considered an irremediable material breach of the Agreement; and (j) maintain all such records of its processing activity as are required of it as a Data Processor acting in accordance with the Data Protection Legislation and on request of Worldpay, make such records available to any Regulatory Authority. 6. Without prejudice to paragraphs 5(a) and 5(i) above, or clause 19.10, where the Supplier 64 wishes to appoint a subcontractor who shall process the Personal Data, the Supplier shall contract with such subcontractor on terms which are the same as or substantively similar to, and no less onerous than, the terms set out in this Agreement in connection with Personal Data and as if the subcontractor were the Supplier, which shall name Worldpay as a third party beneficiary giving Worldpay directly enforceable rights under such agreement and terminate automatically upon the Supplier ceasing to process such Personal Data. 7. The Supplier acknowledges that any consent to a subcontractor provided by Worldpay may be withdrawn by Worldpay if and to the extent that Worldpay reasonably believes that the Personal Data or the rights of the Data Subjects may be compromised by the relevant subcontractor. Any subcontractor approved by Worldpay under this Agreement shall not be entitled to, and the Supplier shall ensure that they do not appoint, any further third party or subprocessor, other than with the consent of Worldpay and pursuant to the terms of Part A of this Schedule. 8. The Supplier shall immediately notify Worldpay upon becoming aware of a breach or suspected breach in respect of any Personal Data Processed by or under the control of the Supplier and shall on an ongoing basis provide Worldpay with all such further relevant information in connection with the breach as such information becomes available so as to enable Worldpay to determine whether to notify the breach to the applicable Regulatory Authority and Data Subjects. Such notification shall at a minimum: (a) describe the nature of the Personal Data breach including where possible, the categories and approximate number of Data Subjects concerned and the categories and approximate number of Personal Data records concerned; (b) the name and contact details of the Data Protection Officer or other contact point where more information can be obtained; (c) the likely consequences of the Personal Data breach; and (d) the measures taken or proposed to be taken by the Supplier to address the Personal Data breach, including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects. 9. The Supplier shall indemnify Worldpay, its officers and\/or directors against all Losses suffered or incurred by Worldpay, its officers and\/or directors arising out of or in connection with the Supplier's breach of Part A of this Schedule. 65 ","contract_name":"CW3466917","file_name":"Cantarus_Framework Svcs Agmt_1221.pdf"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-05-10T09:38:39.091166Z","updated_at":"2022-05-11T16:34:47.081734Z","project":2},{"id":19,"annotations":[{"id":25,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":646,"end":667,"text":"WORLDPAY (UK) LIMITED","labels":["Metadata Fields - Parties - Customer Legal Entity Name"]},"id":"FnfO8BBuYi","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":841,"end":868,"text":"BRAIN LABS DIGITAL LIMITED ","labels":["Metadata Fields - Parties - Counterparty Name"]},"id":"w5JDDj2Crm","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":88,"end":107,"text":"Framework Agreement","labels":["Metadata Fields - Agreement Type"]},"id":"6yNKNVpwcB","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":592,"end":632,"text":"9 September, 2019 (the \"Effective Date”)","labels":["Metadata Fields - Effective Date"]},"id":"7XslCn62v5","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":13832,"end":14016,"text":"2.

CONFIDENTIALITY 9.1 Each Party will, and each will procure that its personnel will keep confidential all Confidential Information of, or concerning, the other's Confidential Information received by it. 9.2 Clause 9.1 does not apply to information: (a) that is published or otherwise generally becomes available to the public, except as a result of a breach of this Agreement; (b) made available to a Party on a non-confidential basis; (c) to the extent required to be disclosed by any Law making body or Regulatory Authority, provided that the disclosing Party notifies the other, to the extent legally permissible, of the information to be disclosed as early as reasonably practicable before the disclosure and takes all reasonable action to avoid or limit the disclosure; (d) was developed independently by the receiving Party without access to, or use or knowledge of, the Confidential Information; or (e) that is already known by the receiving Party without any obligation of confidence. 9.3 Clause 9.1 will not restrict the sharing of any Confidential Information by the receiving Party to its personnel or professional advisors who need to know it to provide the Services and\/or to manage the relationship between the Parties, provided that such persons use it solely for such purpose and are under an obligation to the receiving Party to keep such information confidential. 9.4 Other than as expressly permitted under this Agreement, on termination of this Agreement for whatever reason, each Party will immediately: (a) cease to use any Confidential Information of the other and will return on written demand or, at the other's election, destroy or, so far as is reasonably practicable, permanently erase all copies of that Confidential Information in its possession or control; and (b) certify to the other Party within ten (10) Business Days of the date of termination that this has been done, save that a Party will be permitted to retain such part of that Confidential Information only for the purposes of, and 9 DocuSign Envelope ID: 0BB76D70-BB72-4DD3-9875-5C786CE6FE70 for so long as required by, any Law or its legitimate internal compliance requirements. 9.5 The Supplier shall indemnify Worldpay, its Group Companies, officers and\/or directors against all Losses suffered or incurred by Worldpay, its Group Companies, officers and\/or directors arising out of or in connection with the Supplier's breach of this clause 9. 9.6 The Parties each agree that damages may not be an adequate remedy for any breach of this Clause 9 and, notwithstanding clause 20 (Disputes), the disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek any legal and\/or equitable relief, including an injunction, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this clause 9 in addition to its other remedies under this Agreement or otherwise. 10. SAFEGUARDING DATA 10.1 If the Supplier has access to any Worldpay Data that is Personal Data then the provisions of Part A of Schedule 7 shall apply; if the Supplier has access to any Worldpay Data that is Cardholder Data or any environment storing or processing Cardholder Data, Part B of Schedule 7 shall apply. 11. INFORMATION SECURITY 11.1 Without limiting clause 9.1, the Supplier shall establish, implement and regularly maintain security, processes and plans (the \"Supplier Security Plan”) which shall ensure the confidentiality and security of the Confidential Information, any Worldpay Data, and the Deliverables in accordance with Good Industry Practice and the requirements set out in Schedule 6. 11.2 The Supplier shall ensure that at all times it is operating in accordance with the terms of the Supplier Security Plan. 11.3 The Supplier will on Worldpay's request provide Worldpay or any third party acting on behalf of Worldpay with copies of the Supplier Security Plan and any other documentation relating to the Supplier's compliance with the Agreement's information security requirements and will explain how the Supplier Security Plan meets such information security requirements. 11.4 In the provision of the Services, the Supplier will adopt and use good development and coding practices in line with Good Industry Practice and adhere to any industry standards specified in the SOW. The Supplier will ensure that any application code or other materials developed for Worldpay are sufficiently tested and assured so as to ensure that common security flaws and vulnerabilities are not introduced into Worldpay's systems, products, services or websites. 11.5 The Supplier shall perform Security Tests of its systems (\"Supplier Security Tests”) in a manner and frequency expected in accordance with Good Industry Practice to ensure the Supplier is operating in accordance with the Supplier Security Plan and will share the results of the Supplier Security Tests with Worldpay on request. The Supplier shall permit Worldpay or a security consultant selected and approved by Worldpay to carry out penetration tests on the Supplier's systems (\"Worldpay Security Tests”). The Supplier shall provide Worldpay with all reasonable assistance to enable Worldpay to perform the Worldpay Security Tests. 11.6 If Worldpay considers (acting reasonably) that controls identified or tested in the performance of the Supplier Security Tests or the Worldpay Security Tests: (a) are insufficient to ensure the integrity and security of Worldpay's Confidential Information; or (b) fail to meet the requirements of any Regulatory Authority applicable to Worldpay; or (c) fail to meet industry standards relating to data or information security, then Worldpay may require the Supplier to remedy such insufficiency or failure and the Supplier (at its own cost) shall, as soon as is reasonably practicable, make those modifications. Where the additional measures affect the Supplier's subcontractors, suppliers and agents, the Supplier shall procure that those measures are implemented by the relevant subcontractors, suppliers and agents. 11.7 Upon any suspected or actual breach of any obligations or duties owed by the Supplier to 10 DocuSign Envelope ID: 0BB76D70-BB72-4DD3-9875-5C786CE6FE70 Worldpay relating to information security or confidentiality, including any suspected or actual non-compliance with the Supplier Security Plan which affects the security and\/or confidentiality obligation of the Supplier, the Supplier will immediately remedy the breach and will promptly: (a) notify Worldpay of the breach and the Supplier's proposed remedial measures; (b) implement any actions or remedial measures at its own cost which Worldpay considers necessary as a result of the breach; and (c) provide Worldpay with evidence of the implementation of such remedial measures. 11.8 A breach of this clause 11 shall be a material breach which Worldpay may elect to treat as not capable of remedy for the purposes of this Agreement. 12. BRIBERY 12.1 The Supplier warrants and represents that it and its Personnel shall comply with any applicable Law in force from time to time and receive training at least annually regarding bribery, fraudulent acts and\/or any other corrupt practice. 12.2 If the Supplier, its Personnel or anyone acting on the Supplier's behalf (in all cases whether or not acting with the Supplier's knowledge) breaches this clause 12 Worldpay may terminate this Agreement by written notice with immediate effect. 12.3 The Supplier shall indemnify Worldpay, its Group Companies, officers and\/or directors against all Losses suffered or incurred by Worldpay, its Group Companies, officers and\/or directors arising out of or in connection with the Supplier's breach of this clause 12. 13. TERMINATION 13.1 Worldpay may (without prejudice to its other rights or remedies) terminate this Agreement and\/or an SOW with immediate effect by written notice to the Supplier if: (a) the Supplier commits a material breach of this Agreement or an SOW that is not remediable or, if remediable, is not remedied within fourteen (14) days after being given notice to do so; (b) the Supplier commits repeated or persistent breaches of the same or similar provisions of this Agreement and\/or any SOW (as applicable) which by their repetition become material; (c) a Force Majeure Event persists for ten (10) consecutive Business Days, or fourteen (14) days in any thirty (30) day period; (d) an Insolvency Event occurs in relation to the Supplier; or (e) a change of Control occurs in relation to the Supplier. 13.2 The Supplier may terminate this Agreement and\/or any relevant SOW immediately by notice in writing if Worldpay has failed to pay in full any undisputed amounts contained in an invoice from the Supplier within ninety (90) days of the due date of payment of such invoice provided that at least one written reminder notice has been delivered to Worldpay at least twenty- one (21) days prior to any such termination. 13.3 Except during the first six months of the Term, either Party may terminate: (a) this Agreement for convenience at any time by giving sixty (60) days' prior notice in writing; and (b) any SOW for convenience at any time by giving sixty (60) days' prior notice in writing to the other Party and this Agreement and\/or the relevant Statement of Work shall terminate at the expiry of such notice. 13.4 Upon termination or expiry of this Agreement or a relevant SOW the Supplier shall: (a) transfer all data, works-in-progress and Deliverables to Worldpay or its designated third party; 11 DocuSign Envelope ID: 0BB76D70-BB72-4DD3-9875-5C786CE6FE70 (b) subject to agreeing in advance the Charges (if any) payable, based on the charges set out in Schedule 1 and\/or an applicable SOW: 13.4. b.1 provide all co-operation to Worldpay or its designated third party to enable the migration and transfer of the provision of the Services to Worldpay or to its designated third party without interruption or disruption and to facilitate the orderly transfer of the Services; and 13.4. b.2 continue to provide the relevant Services for a period of no more than six (6) months after the relevant termination or expiry upon Worldpay's request. 13.5 If Worldpay terminates the Agreement or an SOW under clause 13.1(a) or 13.1(b), Worldpay shall not be obliged to pay any charges in connection with the Supplier's obligations set out in clause 13.4(b).2. 13.6 Upon termination of this Agreement all rights and obligations of any Party will cease to have effect immediately, save that the clauses and paragraphs which expressly or by implication have effect after termination will continue to be enforceable notwithstanding such termination (including clauses 5, 6, 7 through 12.3, 13, 14, 17, 19 to 21 and (as applicable) Schedules 6, 7 and 8); and termination will not affect accrued rights, obligations and liabilities of any Party under this Agreement as at the date of termination. 14. LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY 14.1 Nothing in this Agreement shall operate so as to exclude or limit the liability of either Party to the other for: (a) death or personal injury arising out of negligence or fraud; (b) any liability arising in connection with clauses 8.4, 9.5, 12.3, 17 and Schedule 7; (c) the consequences of any wilful default or abandonment of this Agreement (or any SOW, if applicable); or (d) any other liability which cannot be excluded or limited by law. 14.2 Subject to clause 14.1 and 14.4, the total aggregate liability of Worldpay to the Supplier under or in connection with this Agreement including liability for breach of contract, misrepresentation (whether tortious or statutory), tort (including, but not limited to, negligence), breach of statutory duty or otherwise, shall not exceed the total Charges paid to the Supplier under this Agreement. 14.3 Subject to clauses 14.1 and 14.4, the Supplier's total aggregate liability to Worldpay and the Group under or in connection with this Agreement including liability for breach of contract, misrepresentation (whether tortious or statutory), tort (including, but not limited to, negligence), breach of statutory duty or otherwise, shall not exceed the total Charges paid or payable under this Agreement and any SOW. 14.4 Save where specifically set out otherwise in this Agreement or an SOW, neither Party shall be liable, whether in tort (including for negligence or breach of statutory duty), contract, misrepresentation or otherwise for any special, indirect or consequential losses or damage (whether such losses or damage are foreseen, foreseeable, known or otherwise). 14.5 The Supplier shall maintain at its own cost insurance policies with a Reputable Insurance Company (means an insurance provider with a Standard & Poor's credit rating of at least AA- (or with an equivalent rating)) to cover potential liabilities which the Supplier may have to Worldpay under this Agreement or any SOW including: (a) (each in the amount of at least £5 million): Employers Liability, Professional Indemnity Liability\/Cyber and Data Breach insurance; and (b) Public Liability and Product Liability insurance in the amount of at least £5 million. Within seven (7) days of any request by Worldpay, the Supplier shall provide Worldpay with a copy of the insurance policies and any certificate from its insurers or insurance brokers confirming that the insurance is in force and that the current premiums 12 DocuSign Envelope ID: 0BB76D70-BB72-4DD3-9875-5C786CE6FE70 have been paid. 14.6 The Supplier shall maintain insurance policies which incorporate the automatic noting of interests of contracting parties without specific endorsement of named companies and which provide thirty (30) days prior written notice of any cancellation, non-renewal, or material amendment to be given to Worldpay, where any of the foregoing could materially reduce the amount and or scope of the insurances. The insurance policies referred to in clause 14.5 shall include: (a) an indemnity to principals clause providing for an indemnity to Worldpay as principal against legal liability in respect of which the Supplier would have been entitled to an indemnity under the insurance if the claim had been made against the Supplier provided that Worldpay as principal shall, be subject to the terms of the insurance in so far as they can apply; and (b) a clause waiving the insurer's subrogation rights against Worldpay, its employees and agents. 15. DISABLING DEVICES 15.1 The Supplier shall ensure that no Disabling Device is introduced into the Services, the Deliverables or Worldpay's information technology environment. 15.2 The Supplier shall immediately notify Worldpay upon the discovery of any such introduction of the Disabling Device and take all necessary remedial action to eliminate the Disabling Device from the affected item and mitigate any loss of operational efficiency or data. 16. BUSINESS CONTINUITY AND FORCE MAJEURE 16.1 The Supplier will ensure that at all times it has in place and is able to implement a business continuity and disaster recovery plan (\"BCDR Plan”) in accordance with its terms. If required, the Supplier will explain to Worldpay how the features set out in the BCDR Plan will interface with any business continuity and disaster recovery plans and procedures of Worldpay notified to the Supplier from time to time. 16.2 The Supplier shall develop, update, test and\/or exercise the BCDR Plan on a regular basis and, in any event, not less than once in every twelve (12) month period, in accordance with Good Industry Practice and if reasonably requested by Worldpay, the Supplier will engage an independent third party to test, audit and verify the Supplier's BCDR Plan at the Supplier's expense. 16.3 The Supplier shall, within thirty (30) days of any test of the BCDR Plan send to Worldpay a written report summarising the results of the test and shall promptly implement any actions or remedial measures which Worldpay considers necessary as a result of those tests. 16.4 The Supplier will permit Worldpay to have sight of the BCDR Plan upon reasonable notice at any time. If Worldpay considers (on reasonable grounds) that the BCDR Plan is insufficient to ensure the continued performance and operational resilience of the Services or fails to meet the requirements of any Regulator then Worldpay may require the Supplier to modify the BCDR Plan to cure such insufficiency or failure and the Supplier will promptly make the modifications that Worldpay require. 16.5 If a Force Majeure Event directly prevents a Party (the \"Affected Party”) from complying with any of its obligations under this Agreement and\/or any SOW (as applicable), the Affected Party may be excused from performance, and any liability for non-performance, of those obligations, for the duration of the Force Majeure Event, save that a Party is not entitled to rely on this clause 16.5 to the extent that it fails to take all reasonable steps to mitigate, avoid, circumvent, overcome and\/or minimise the period of the delay (including in the case of the Supplier, to implement the BCDR Plan) or to provide reasonable precautions or workarounds. The Affected Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to recommence performance or observance whenever and to whatever extent possible without 13 DocuSign Envelope ID: 0BB76D70-BB72-4DD3-9875-5C786CE6FE70 delay. 16.6 A Force Majeure Event shall not relieve the Supplier of its obligations to comply with the BCDR Plan, including requiring that essential Personnel report to work at a contingency location. 16.7 A breach of clause 16.1, 16.2, 16.3 and\/or 16.4 shall be a material breach which Worldpay may elect to treat as not capable of remedy for the purposes of this Agreement. 17. TUPE 17.1 The Supplier agrees to arrange Personnel in relation to the Services in such a way that no individual at any time (a) forms part of an organised grouping of employees which has as its principal purpose the provision of the Services or (b) no Personnel is\/are wholly or mainly assigned to the provision of the Services. 17.2 The parties agree and acknowledge that on the expiry of this Agreement, an SOW or at the cessation of any Services being provided by the Supplier (referred to as the \"End Date” for the purposes of this Agreement), the parties do not intend that any of the employees of either Party or their respective subcontractors will transfer to the other under the provisions of the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 (SI 2006\/246) as amended or replaced or any other regulations implementing the Acquired Rights Directive (\"TUPE”). 17.3 If any Personnel who were employed or otherwise engaged immediately prior to the End Date (\"Affected Employee”) should claim to be employed by Worldpay or a replacement supplier to Worldpay as a result of the provisions of TUPE applying in relation to this Agreement or an SOW then Worldpay shall, upon becoming aware of such claim, notify the Supplier in writing within fourteen (14) days and allow the Supplier the period of twenty eight (28) days from receipt of such notification either to offer employment to that person or take other steps with a view to obtaining a written withdrawal of that person's claim to be employed by Worldpay or a replacement supplier. 17.4 If the Affected Employee accepts employment with the Supplier, Worldpay shall immediately release that person from its employment or alleged employment. 17.5 The Supplier shall: (a) remain responsible throughout the period between the End Date and either the date of withdrawal of the Affected Employee's claim or the Supplier's release (per clause 17.4) for the payment of all salary and benefits to that person; and (b) indemnify Worldpay against all Employee Liabilities arising out of or in connection with non-payment of the same. 17.6 If the Affected Employee's claim that they are employed by Worldpay or a replacement supplier is not withdrawn or resolved within twenty eight (28) days of the Supplier being notified, Worldpay or the replacement supplier may terminate the Affected Employee's employment within fourteen (14) days of the twenty eight (28) Business Day period expiring. In such circumstances, the Supplier shall indemnify Worldpay against all Employee Liabilities arising out of or in connection with: (i) any claim or other legal recourse brought by the Affected Employee in respect of any fact or matter concerning or arising from their employment with the Supplier or its subcontractor and\/or their transfer to Worldpay or a replacement supplier; (ii) such person's salary and benefits; and (iii) the termination of the employment of such Affected Employee for whatever reason but excluding any Employee Liabilities arising out of or in connection with any claim of discrimination in respect of the act of termination itself by Worldpay or a replacement supplier, any failure on Worldpay's or a replacement supplier's part to follow any statutory minimum dismissal procedures or the payment by Worldpay or a replacement supplier of any ex gratia sum or settlement which is 14 DocuSign Envelope ID: 0BB76D70-BB72-4DD3-9875-5C786CE6FE70 not approved in writing in advance by the Supplier (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 17.7 In the event that TUPE applies to any Personnel, the Supplier shall indemnify Worldpay, its Group Companies, officers and\/or directors against all Losses suffered or incurred by Worldpay, its Group Companies, officers and\/or directors arising out of or in connection with Worldpay's compliance with TUPE or any failure by the Supplier, its subcontractors and\/or Personnel to comply with TUPE in relation to their employees and\/or the transfer of such employees. 17.8 Both parties shall comply with Regulation 13 of TUPE in so far as TUPE applies to that Party and shall share information with each other and any replacement suppliers to enable each Party to comply with the same. 17.9 Worldpay may in its absolute discretion assign the benefit of the indemnities contained in this clause 17 to a replacement supplier or replacement suppliers. 18. CHANGE CONTROL 18.1 A change to all or any part of the Agreement and\/or an SOW shall only be agreed in accordance with this clause 18. 18.2 Either Party may request in writing a change to the Services (\"Change Request”) by notifying the other's Representative. 18.3 The Supplier Representative will, within ten (10) Business Days of receiving a Worldpay Change Request, explain to Worldpay's Representative in writing what impact implementing that Change Request would have upon the Charges, any delivery dates and (where appropriate) the Services (\"Change Information”). 18.4 Worldpay will have fifteen (15) Business Days following receipt of the Change Information to accept or reject the proposed change to the Services. The Parties' Representatives shall agree the terms of the change in writing which, once signed by both Parties, shall constitute a change to this Agreement and\/or the relevant SOW. 18.5 Any change to an SOW made in accordance with this clause shall be made in the form of the template set out in Schedule 4, or such other form as the Parties agree. 19.

If such provision would cease to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable if some part of that provision were modified or deleted, the provision in question will apply with the least such modification or deletion as may be necessary to make the provision legal, valid and enforceable. 19.6 Notices - Any notice required under this Agreement will be in writing, to the Parties' respective Representatives addresses appearing at the head of this Agreement, or such other address as the Parties may advise at a later date.

Any waiver by either Party of any of its rights under this Agreement must be in writing and signed by a duly authorised representative. 19.9 Counterparts - This Agreement may be executed and delivered in any number of counterparts, each of which is an original and which, together, have the same effect as if each Party had signed the same document. 19.10 Assignment - The Supplier shall not assign or sub-contract its obligations under this Agreement to any third party without the prior written consent of Worldpay. Worldpay may at any time assign, transfer, novate or subcontract any or all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to any Group Company or any third party. 19.11 Continuing obligations - Where the Supplier has sub-contracted any of the Services, the Supplier will remain liable to Worldpay for the acts or omissions of its subcontractors. 19.12 Entire Agreement - This Agreement constitutes the whole agreement between the Parties, and replaces and extinguishes all previous agreements, undertakings, or collateral contracts of any nature made by the parties, whether oral or written, in relation to its subject matter.

Communications between the Parties during the process set out in this Clause 20.1 whether oral or in writing, will not be admissible as evidence in any legal process unless in writing and signed by both Parties. 20.2 Should the Dispute remain unresolved within a maximum of ten (10) Business Days after it has been referred under clause 20.1, the Dispute may be referred for determination as follows: (a) if the Dispute is of a technical nature relating to the performance of the Services or the functionality or performance of the Deliverables, or any similar or related matter, to an expert (an \"Expert\"), who will act as expert and not as arbitrator; and (b) in all other cases, to the courts in terms of clause 21. 20.3 The Expert will be selected by agreement of both Parties.

Governing Terms: This Quote is subject to: (a) a separate written agreement between Customer or Customer’s affiliate and Supplier or a Supplier's affiliate to the extent that it expressly applies to the products and\/or services in this Quote or, to the extent there is no such agreement, to the applicable set of Dell’s Terms of Sale (available at http:\/\/www.dell.com\/terms or www.dell.com\/oemterms); and (b) the terms referenced herein (collectively, the “Governing Terms”). Different Governing Terms may apply to different products and services on this Quote. The Governing Terms apply to the exclusion of all terms and conditions incorporated in or referred to in any documentation submitted by Customer to Supplier. Supplier Software Licenses and Services Descriptions: Customer’s use of any Supplier software is subject to the license terms accompanying the software, or in the absence of accompanying terms, the applicable terms posted on www.Dell.com\/eula. Descriptions and terms for Supplier-branded standard services are stated at www.dell.com\/servicecontracts\/global or for certain infrastructure products at www.dellemc.com\/en-us\/customer-services\/product-warranty-and-service-descriptions.htrr.

In case of Financing only: If Customer intends to enter into a financing arrangement (“Financing Agreement”) for the products and\/or services on this Quote with Dell Financial Services LLC or other funding source pre-approved by Supplier (“FS”), Customer may issue its purchase order to Supplier or to FS. If issued to FS, Supplier will fulfill and invoice FS upon confirmation that: (a) FS intends to enter into a Financing Agreement with Customer for this order; and (b) FS agrees to procure these items from Supplier. Notwithstanding the Financing Agreement, Customer’s use (and Customer’s resale of and the end-user’s use) of these items in the order is subject to the applicable governing agreement between Customer and Supplier, except that title shall transfer from Supplier to FS instead of to Customer.

In consideration of the payments to be made and services to be performed hereunder, the parties agree as follows: TERMS AND CONDITIONS 1. DEFINITIONS 1.1. References. In this Agreement, references and mention of the word \"includes\" and \"including\" shall mean \"includes, without limitation\" and \"including, without limitation,\" as applicable. 1.2. Interpretation. In the event of a conflict between the general terms and conditions and the terms of any exhibits and schedules attached hereto, the terms of the schedules and exhibits shall prevail and control the interpretation of the Agreement. The exhibits and schedules together with the general terms and conditions shall be interpreted as a single document. 2. BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP 2.1. Services. Provider shall supply the services described in Schedule A to this Agreement (the “Services”). Provider grants to FIS the exclusive, worldwide right and license, solely as set forth in Section 2.5 below (in all other cases, the grant is non-exclusive), (“Software License”) to use an object code (executable) version of the Provider's EMX Enterprise software (“Licensed Software”) solely to rebrand and resell the Services under its own private label to business and commercial entities, including, but not limited to, financial institutions (collectively, “FIS Customers”) in the form of separate and distinct (i) Software as a Service agreements (“SaaS Agreements”) with certain FIS Customers by and through which such FIS Customer may access and use the Service (such FIS Customers, the “SaaS Customers”) or (ii) sublicense agreements (“License Agreements”) with certain FIS Customers by and through which such FIS Customer is licensed a copy of the Licensed Software (such FIS Customers, the “License Customers”). This license will permit FIS to provide the Services to process FIS Customers' Data and support the Services. Provider also grants FIS a non-exclusive, worldwide right to use, reproduce and distribute to FIS Customers Provider's documentation that describes the proper procedures for using the Licensed Software and provides sufficient information to enable FIS to operate and maintain the Licensed Software (“Licensed Documentation”). 2.2. FIS acknowledges and agrees that: A. if FIS substantively modifies the Licensed Documentation, Provider is not responsible for, and Provider's warranty of the Licensed Documentation does not extend to, such modifications. B. FIS' reverse engineering or modification in any way of the Licensed Software is a material breach under the Agreement. C. Provider's logo and statement “Powered by Eco-Mail,” will at all times remain clearly visible, on the bottom each screen, regardless of the branding by FIS. 1 D. The license granted in this Section 2.2 does not grant FIS the right to use the Licensed Software for FIS' own purposes (except to perform its rights and obligations under this Agreement); such use will require FIS to execute a separate SaaS Agreement or Enterprise License, as applicable, with Provider. E. If FIS enters into License Agreements with License Customers, Provider will, on behalf of FIS, and as a condition to FIS entering into such License Agreements, provide support and maintenance to the License Customers pursuant to the Software Maintenance terms attached hereto as Schedule B. F. If FIS enters into SaaS Agreements with SaaS Customers, Provider will provide support and maintenance to FIS pursuant to the Software Maintenance terms attached hereto as Schedule B. G. If FIS or any FIS Customer needs support and maintenance other than as described in Schedule B, Provider will bill FIS for such support and maintenance at Provider's professional services rates as specified in Schedule A. 2.3 Provided the SaaS Agreement and\/or Sales Order and\/or License Agreement with each FIS Customer is in compliance with this Agreement, including, but not limited to, Schedule A, and Schedule B, FIS shall not be required to submit such SaaS Agreement and\/or each Sales Order and\/or License Agreement to Provider for its prior review. If, however, any term of the SaaS Agreement and\/or Sales Order and\/or License Agreement with an FIS Customer deviates in any material manner from the terms of this Agreement, FIS will obtain Provider's prior written approval to each such material deviation. 2.4 Implementation. The Services shall be implemented and made available by Provider for FIS's use on such implementation date and for such fees as is set forth in the applicable Schedule or mutually agreed by the parties. Any and all conditions on FIS's access to or use of the Services shall be set forth in Schedule A hereto. 2.5 Exclusive Channel. Provider agrees that, provided FIS complies with this Section 2.5, FIS shall be the exclusive reseller distribution channel for up to three years, for providing the Services under a SaaS Agreement as an Application Service Provider (\"ASP\") in a hosted environment under a SaaS Agreement solely to financial institutions with a primary Standard Industrial Classification code beginning with 60 (Depository Institutions), 61 (Nondepository credit institutions), and 62 (Security and Commodity Brokers, Dealers, Exchanges, and Services) (collectively \"Financial Institutions\"). The exclusivity granted by this Section 2.5 will begin upon the Effective Date and will continue until December 31, 2020 (\"First Exclusivity Period\"). The exclusivity will automatically be renewed for a period of one year (until December 31, 2021) (\"Second Exclusivity Period\") if FIS executes contracts resulting in payments by FIS to Provider hereunder of fees of at least $1,000,000 during the First Exclusivity Period. On December 31, 2021, this exclusivity will automatically be renewed for a period of one more year (until December 31, 2022) (\"Final Exclusivity Period\") if, FIS executes contracts resulting in payments by FIS to Provider hereunder of fees of at least $3,000,000 during the Second Exclusivity Period. In the event that FIS does not meet the annual automatic renewal targets for either the First Exclusivity Period or the Second Exclusivity Period, the exclusivity provided under this Section 2.5 shall cease on the last day of the applicable exclusivity period for which the target was not achieved unless the Provider, in its sole discretion, determines to continue exclusivity for an additional number of months, to be determined by Provider. Unless otherwise terminated earlier, as provided in the preceding sentences, the exclusivity provided in this Section 2.5 will automatically terminate on the last day of the Final Exclusivity Period. For the avoidance of doubt (i) the exclusivity provided in this Section 2.5 is solely granted to FIS in its capacity as an ASP or hosting service provider and shall not apply to the Provider's or any other party's sale or 2 resale of the Services to customers as licensed software and (ii) FIS may also resell the Services without serving as an ASP, but FIS has no exclusivity for such sales. A. Furthermore, this Section 2.5 shall not apply to the following situations: 1. Providers of outsourced mailroom services which include the provision or management of physical mail delivery where such party already has an existing contract for physical mail sorting and delivery may resell the Services either in a hosted or licensed capacity to their existing customer base 2. Provider may participate as a provider of software to any participant in a formal RFP competitive process initiated by any company, including Financial Institutions as described in this provision. Participants in open RFP processes, may host the Provider's software as a component of their proposal. FIS acknowledges and agrees that the exclusivity granted to FIS under this Agreement is limited to specific financial institutions and solely for the stated time period, all as set forth in Section 2.5 above. Provider is, at all times, free to enter into agreements with other companies or individuals for the resale or licensing of its Services except as prohibited hereunder. 2.6 Non-solicitation. FIS shall own the relationship with all FIS Customers.. Within five (5) business days of the end of each calendar month, FIS shall deliver to Provider a list of FIS Customers and prospective customers with whom FIS has engaged during such calendar month regarding the Services (each, a \"Prospective FIS Customer”), and, with respect to Prospective FIS Customers, the first date and method by which the Prospective FIS Customer was contacted and the status of such discussions. In addition, the parties will hold a monthly call to discuss the content of such list. Provided Provider has reasonable advance written notice of an FIS Customer or FIS' ongoing or active resale effort to a Prospective FIS Customer, during the term of this Agreement, Provider shall not, without the express written consent of FIS, directly or through any other reseller, solicit any FIS Customers or Prospective FIS Customers or their respective customers for any products or services unless the underlying SaaS Agreement between FIS and the FIS Customer is terminated, in which case FIS agrees that Provider may approach such FIS Customer to provide the Services directly.

(a) Terms of Payment. Within ten (10) business days of the end of each calendar month, FIS will provide Provider with a monthly report with sufficient detail to enable Provider to determine each FIS Customer's use of the Services.

Any such audits shall be performed during normal FIS business hours by providing written notice to FIS at least thirty (30) days prior to such audit. If any such audit reveals an understatement of gross sales by FIS to Provider hereunder, FIS shall immediately pay Provider the amount of fees due on such understatement.

General Software Maintenance Terms. The terms of this Schedule B apply to the Provider's maintenance obligations to FIS in the support of the SaaS Services and when FIS licenses the Licensed Software to a License Customer, in which case License Customer will be required to enter into a software license and maintenance agreement with FIS pursuant to which FIS (through Provider) will provide the following maintenance and support Services (\"Software Maintenance”) for the Licensed Software (for the avoidance of doubt, these terms will not apply to a SaaS Customer): (a) preventive and remedial services to maintain the Licensed Software in good operating condition; (b) corrections, enhancements, improvements, releases, versions and other updates (other than Optional Updates as defined in Section 10 below) for the Licensed Software (\"Updates”); (c) a telephone support line (direct to the License Customer) for use within the United States, and, if applicable, a telephone support line which can be accessed internationally; (d) online access to technical support bulletins; 2. Additional Responsibilities. (a) Provider. The Provider personnel assigned to perform Software Maintenance will be fully qualified to do so and familiar with both the applicable Licensed Software and FIS' and License Customer's use of that Licensed Software. (b) FIS. The following terms are applicable to FIS or a Licensed Customer, as applicable (for the purposes of this section \"FIS” is referenced): (i) When FIS requests maintenance and support, FIS will provide Provider's maintenance and support personnel with access to FIS personnel that are knowledgeable about IT support issues generally or the Licensed Software specifically (ii) If the problem that FIS is experiencing cannot be reasonably duplicated at Provider's support facilities, to receive maintenance and support, FIS will provide Provider access to the equipment experiencing the problem. In such an event, if FIS does not provide Provider with such access, Provider's sole remedy is to deny FIS support and maintenance for the issue within the scope of this Section 2(b)(ii). For clarity, in such instances, Provider's refusal to provide support and maintenance is not a breach of the Agreement. (iii) In some instances, Provider cannot know that FIS is experiencing Errors unless FIS informs the Provider. In such instances, to receive support and maintenance services for such Errors, FIS must report the Errors to Provider in through the Provider Support Portal (as defined below) to receive maintenance and support for the same. In such an event, Provider will not know that there are Errors and is not obligated to provide maintenance or support for such Errors. (iv) FIS will retain back up copies of the Licensed Software. Provider will not store data that FIS processes using the Licensed Software. As a result, if FIS does not retain such data, Provider is unable to provide (and is not obligated to provide) Software Maintenance that requires re-loading of lost or corrupted data. . 19 (v) In some instances, FIS will need to provide timely transmission, release, or access to critical information as defined or requested by Provider to analyze and remediate Errors reported by FIS. In such instances, FIS must provide the same to receive maintenance and support services for the issue(s). (vi) FIS will notify Provider, in advance, of any significant changes made to FIS' IT environment that could reasonably be expected to adversely impact Provider's ability to perform Software Maintenance Services. (vii) Additional Support. FIS will train (or have Provider train) its personnel in the use and application of the Licensed Software. (c) If FIS requires Provider to come onsite for maintenance and support services beyond the scope of the maintenance\/support program, the parties will negotiate a Schedule for such services in good faith. For the avoidance of doubt, expenses will be reimbursed in accordance with the Agreement. 3. Support for Software Maintenance. Provider will provide FIS\/Licensed Customer with unlimited telephone support to the Designated Contact Persons (described in Section 4 below) to resolve questions about the implementation, configuration, use and operation of the Licensed Software, as well as the status of problems reported by FIS for issues covered by the scope of the support and maintenance program. The scope of the maintenance and support program is described in the Agreement and\/or applicable Schedule. Telephone support and Internet support will be available 24 hours per day, seven days per week, except as specified otherwise in the applicable Schedule. Provider will respond to FIS and resolve problems in accordance with the service levels set forth in the applicable Schedule. If the Schedule does not specify service levels or timeframes for performance, Provider will respond to and resolve Software Service Calls (as defined below) and perform its other obligations in a timely manner. 4. Service Calls; Tracking for Software Maintenance. FIS may place requests for Software Maintenance (\"Software Service Calls”) by entering a request in Provider's support portal (\"Support Portal”). Software Service Calls may be made only by the FIS Relationship Manager who may in turn designate no more than 10 individuals who will be authorized to contact Provider (each, a \"Designated Contact Person”). The Relationship Manager will provide Provider a written list (email is sufficient) of the Designated Contact Persons, which may be revised by the Relationship Manager from time to time. The Designated Contact Persons will use reasonable efforts to provide all information that Provider reasonably requests about each Software Service Call. Provider will maintain a record of all Software Service Calls and Provider's efforts to resolve problems. Provider will provide the Designated Contact Persons with a unique ticket number for each Software Service Call. In the event of concurrent Software Service Calls, FIS reserves the right to set the priority for the resolution of the problems. 5. Remedial Software Maintenance. Provider will promptly notify FIS of any Errors or other nonconformities in the Licensed Software. \"Error” means any error, defect or malfunction in the Licensed Software that: (a) causes the integrity of the Licensed Software's data to be compromised or corrupted; (b) causes an unexpected error message or fatal error to occur while using the Licensed Software; (c) causes the Licensed Software to fail to conform to any of the applicable warranties; or (d) otherwise causes the Licensed Software to fail . Provider will correct all Errors, repair or replace all defective or inoperable Licensed Software and otherwise cause the Licensed Software to be functioning in accordance with the service levels set forth in the applicable Schedule. 20 6.

Updates for Licensed Software will be deemed part of the Licensed Software. 7. Compatibility; Prior Version Support for Licensed Software. Provider represents and warrants that each Update will be compatible with each preceding version of the Licensed Software, including versions customized for FIS or Licensed Customers. Provider will continue to provide Software Maintenance for: (a) each Update for at least 48 months after delivery to FIS, and (b) at least the two immediately prior major Updates provided to FIS. The term “major Update” (also sometimes referred to as “version”) means an Update containing substantially enhanced business functionality not previously included in the Licensed Software. 8. Software Platforms. Provider will continue to maintain the Licensed Software in a form compatible with the most current equivalent forms and at least the two immediately prior versions of the operating systems, database systems, hardware and other third party platforms that FIS or Licensed Customers are using with the Licensed Software. Within a commercially reasonable time after a new version of any of those third party platforms becomes generally available, Provider will issue an Update to ensure that the Licensed Software remains compatible with that platform. If FIS or a Recipient elects to use another platform supported by Provider, then upon FIS' written request, which will include specific detail about the alternate platform configuration and specifications, Provider will deliver to FIS, copies of any generally available versions of the Licensed Software certified for use with the alternate platform at no additional charge (except additional license charges if specifically stated in the applicable Schedule). 9. Remote Access to Provide Software Maintenance. Except as expressly specified in the applicable Schedule, in no event will FIS or a Licensed Customer be required to provide Provider with any remote access to any FIS computer or network. In any event, Provider will not access any FIS computer or network unless this Agreement includes System Access Terms. 10. Fees for Software Maintenance Updates. There will be no charge for Updates (other than Optional Updates). Provider may charge for those Optional Updates requested and Accepted by FIS. Fees for Optional Updates will be as set forth in the applicable Schedule or Provider's prevailing license fees (less applicable FIS discounts) (whichever fees are lowest). The term “Optional Update” means an Update that: (a) is not required to cause the Software to be in Compliance or otherwise meet the requirements of this Agreement or applicable Law, (b) Provider licenses separately from each component of the Licensed Software for all of its customers, (c) Provider does not provide to any other customer without additional charge under any maintenance arrangement, and (d) provides substantially enhanced business (not merely technical) functionality. Functionality that supports new operating systems, database platforms or other third party technology will be considered technical functionality, rather than enhanced business functionality, and will be provided at no additional charge. 11. EXCEPTIONS Unless otherwise set forth in the applicable Schedule, the following services are excluded from Software Maintenance, which services are subject to availability of resources and, upon execution of the applicable professional services Schedule, will be charged for separately at the applicable professional services rates: (a) Software Maintenance does not cover Errors solely caused by: (i) unusual physical, electrical or electromagnetic stress; (ii) failure or fluctuation of electric power, air conditioning or humidity control; (iii) failure of rotation media not furnished by Provider; and (iv) excessive heating; fire and smoke damage. 21 (b) Software Maintenance does not cover Errors solely caused by the operation of the Licensed Software with other media and hardware, software or telecommunication interfaces not meeting or not maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications..; For clarity this Section 11 does not relieve Provider of its obligation to provide Software Maintenance when: (a) FIS' failure to update said other media, hardware, software or telecommunication; or (b) Provider modifies the Licensed Software to comply with FIS' use of media, hardware, software, or telecommunication interfaces that are not maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications. (c) Software Maintenance does not cover Errors solely caused by FIS or its agents. (d) Provider is not obligated to provide Software Maintenance for Errors solely caused by FIS knowingly and materially deviating from the specified operating procedures in the Licensed Documentation. (e) Software Maintenance does not cover Errors solely caused by the modification, alteration or addition, or attempted modification, alteration or addition, of the Licensed Software undertaken by persons other than Provider. For clarity, configuring the Licensed Software is not a modification, alteration, or addition that removes Provider's obligation to provide Software Maintenance. (f) Software Maintenance applies to the Licensed Software (including modifications made by the Provider on behalf of FIS), but does not extend to software programs made by FIS or other parties, or customized programs made by other parties. (g) Problems related to a prioritization or reprioritization of tasks by FIS, where Provider has notified FIS in advance that such prioritization or reprioritization may affect the operation of the Licensed Software and where FIS approves the change regardless of this notification. (h) Software Maintenance does not cover errors or malfunctions for any development, test or training systems environments except to the extent that FIS or a Licensed Customer identifies a functional error in the Licensed Software's then current feature set. In such instances, FIS and Provider shall establish a mutually agreed remediation schedule. (i) For any delay in or failure of by Provider or FIS under the Agreement or any applicable Schedule if such delay or failure arises by any reasons beyond either party's reasonable control, including any act of God, any acts of the common enemy, the elements, earthquakes, floods, fires, epidemics, riots, failures or delay in transportation or communications or utilities, or any act or failure to act by the other party or such other party's officers, employees, agents or contractors; provided, however, that lack of funds shall not be deemed to be a reason beyond a party's reasonable control. 22 SCHEDULE C Microsoft SQL Server 23 ","contract_name":"CW3462633","file_name":"Eco-Mail Development_Master Reseller Agmt_0220.pdf"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-05-10T09:38:39.086233Z","updated_at":"2022-05-11T16:21:26.887077Z","project":2},{"id":13,"annotations":[{"id":22,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":236,"end":299,"text":" FIS PAYMENT SOLUTIONS & SERVICES INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED (\"FIS\")","labels":["Metadata Fields - Parties - Customer Legal Entity Name"]},"id":"iOEb9zHJYP","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":564,"end":602,"text":" Diebold Nixdorf India Private Limited","labels":["Metadata Fields - Parties - Counterparty Name"]},"id":"2G5RdQ1wzX","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":57,"end":112,"text":"SERVICE ATTACHMENT NUMBER 5 (this \"Service Attachment\")","labels":["Metadata Fields - Agreement Type"]},"meta":{"text":["Addendum"]},"id":"3iwzvTS2dS","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":16669,"end":16704,"text":"1st January 2021 (\"Effective Date\")","labels":["Metadata Fields - Effective Date"]},"id":"gINBcr2PcQ","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":16785,"end":16805,"text":"30th September 2022 ","labels":["Metadata Fields - Expiry Date (Date format)"]},"id":"nu0sqJ_tcJ","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":18368,"end":18374,"text":"25,650","labels":["Metadata Fields - Total Contract Value"]},"id":"V_jG9dWjmv","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":16596,"end":17030,"text":"Term of Services This term of this services attachment shall commence on 1st January 2021 (\"Effective Date\") and shall continue to be in force for a period of 1 (One) Years 9 (Nine) Months 30th September 2022 (the \"Initial Term\"), unless terminated pursuant to the provisions of the Agreement.

Escalation Procedure; Alternative Dispute Resolution. Master Consulting Services Agreement - General Terms Page 14 DocuSign Envelope ID: C85D0842-346C-4605-ACBC-7B5083CA7A8E 20.1 Escalation Procedure. FIS and Consultant will first attempt to resolve any dispute, difference, controversy or claim under this Agreement between their respective project managers identified in the Engagement Document. Each party shall escalate any and all unresolved disputes by notifying the other party in writing that it desires to elevate the matter to the FIS-designated executive officer of FIS and the Consultant-designated executive officer of Consultant for resolution. Upon receipt by the other party of such written notice, the matter shall be so elevated and the FIS- designated executive officer of FIS and the Consultant-designated executive officer of Consultant shall negotiate in good faith and each use its reasonable best efforts to resolve any remaining issues. The location, format, frequency, duration and conclusion of these elevated discussions shall be left to the discretion of the representatives involved. Upon mutual agreement, the representatives may utilize other alternative dispute resolution procedures to assist in the negotiations. All discussions and correspondence among the representatives for purposes of these negotiations shall be treated as Confidential Information developed for purposes of settlement, exempt from discovery and production, which shall not be admissible in any subsequent proceedings between the parties. Documents identified in or provided with such communications, which are not prepared for purposes of the negotiations, are not so exempted and may, if otherwise admissible, be admitted in evidence in such subsequent proceeding. If the disputed matter remains unresolved after the escalation procedure set forth above, then either party may, within thirty (30) calendar days after the representatives have met to address such matter, request binding arbitration of the issue in accordance with Section 20.2 below. 20.2 Alternative Dispute Resolution. FIS and Consultant will settle any dispute, difference, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the Agreement by binding arbitration before a single arbitrator in Jacksonville, Florida in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules (including Procedures for Large, Complex Commercial Disputes) of the American Arbitration Association. Judgment on any resulting award may be entered into by any court having jurisdiction over the parties or their respective property. The arbitrator will decide any issues submitted in accordance with the provisions and commercial purposes of the Agreement, and will not have the power to award damages in excess of the limitations set forth in, or damages excluded by, the Agreement. FIS and Consultant may elect to engage in non-binding mediation as a first alternative to binding arbitration or litigation as provided in this Section 20. Any such election must be mutual and reflected in a writing signed by both parties. Each party will bear its own costs in arbitration, and in any such mediation, and the parties will share equally all third party arbitration or mediation costs, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties. 21. Jurisdiction. Subject to the arbitration requirement set forth in Section 20 above, venue for any litigation arising out of or otherwise relating to the Agreement will be in state and federal courts of competent jurisdiction located in Duval County, Florida, which will have exclusive jurisdiction over such litigation. Nothing in the Agreement will prevent either party from seeking any stay of proceedings or preliminary or temporary injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction either to enforce the parties’ agreement to arbitrate or mediate any dispute under Section 20 above or to enjoin the other party’s breach of its information security or confidentiality obligations under the Agreement. THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE AGREEMENT. 22. Divestiture. FIS may partially assign the Agreement with respect to any Service or Deliverable used by an FIS Affiliate, or a division, department or other segment of FIS or an FIS Affiliate, that is the subject of a divestiture by FIS or an FIS Affiliate (regardless of the form of transaction) pursuant to a mutually acceptable partial assignment agreement between FIS or the FIS Affiliate, Consultant and the assignee. 23. Illegal Activities. With respect to the Agreement, Consultant covenants and agrees that neither it nor any of its directors, officers, agents, Consultant Personnel or other persons associated with or acting on behalf of it has made, will make, has given, or will give any payments or inducements, directly or indirectly, to any government officials in the jurisdictions in which Consultant conducts business in connection with any opportunity, agreement, license, permit, certificate, consent, order, approval, registration, waiver or other authorization relating to the business of Consultant, except for such payments or inducements as were lawful under the written Laws of such jurisdictions. With respect to the Agreement, Consultant covenants and agrees that neither Consultant nor any of its directors, officers or agents, nor any Consultant Personnel or other persons associated with or acting on behalf of Consultant: (i) has used, or will use any corporate funds for any unlawful contribution, gift, entertainment or other unlawful expense relating to political activity; (ii) has made, or will make any direct or indirect unlawful payment to any government official or employee from corporate funds; or (iii) has made, or will make any bribe, unlawful rebate, pay off, influence payment, kickback or other unlawful payment in connection with the business of Consultant. With respect to the Agreement, Consultant covenants and agrees that neither Consultant nor any of its directors, officers or agents, nor any Consultant Personnel or other persons associated with or acting on behalf of Consultant has violated, is in violation of, or will violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and any amendments thereto. Consultant additionally covenants and agrees that it will not retain any sub-agent, sub-contractor, or representative without the prior written consent of a senior executive officer of FIS. Consultant understands, acknowledges and agrees that FIS will have an irrevocable right to immediately terminate the Agreement as a result of any breach by Consultant of any such undertakings, representations, and agreements set forth herein. Master Consulting Services Agreement - General Terms Page 15 DocuSign Envelope ID: C85D0842-346C-4605-ACBC-7B5083CA7A8E 24. Financial Statements and Material Adverse Events. On or before the Effective Date, and annually thereafter during the Term, Consultant will provide to FIS a complete set of Consultant’s financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied which have been compiled, attested or audited by an independent certified public accounting firm. In the event FIS reasonably determines after review of such financial statements that Consultant’s financial condition is such that it may not allow Consultant to continue to perform all of its obligations under the Agreement, then FIS may terminate the Agreement, without penalty, by providing fifteen (15) days’ prior written notice to Consultant. Failure by Consultant to provide the required financial information to FIS in a timely manner will constitute a material breach of the Agreement. 25. Audit or Inspections. Consultant will keep complete, accurate, and up-to-date books and records in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and sound business practices covering all transactions relating to the Agreement. During the Term and for any period FIS is subject to examination with respect to the Services upon at least ten (10) business days prior written notice from FIS, Consultant or its agents will provide FIS, FIS’ agents, or any of FIS’ regulators , and any Client(s) receiving Services, with access to and any reasonable assistance that they may require with respect to any Consultant office or location where the Services are performed for the purposes of performing audits or inspections of the Services and the business of FIS relating to the Services. Such audits will be conducted by FIS, FIS’ agents, FIS’ regulators or Client(s) during regular business hours at any Consultant office or location where the Services are performed. If any audit by an auditor designated by FIS, a FIS agent or a regulatory authority results in Consultant being notified that Consultant or Consultant’s agents are not in compliance with any Law or any requirement of the Agreement, Consultant will remedy any such noncompliance within thirty (30) days. Consultant will bear the expense of any such compliance. Any audit hereunder will be subject to the following limitations: (i) use of any third party auditor that is a competitor of Consultant will be subject to Consultant’s prior written approval, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed; and (ii) FIS or any auditor conducting any such audit will at all times comply with any and all reasonable security and confidentiality guidelines and other policies of Consultant with respect to the audit. Consultant will have an independent third party annually prepare, and will make available to FIS, a Type II SOC 2 report concerning its operations, systems, controls and procedures, in accordance with Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) No. 18 and, at FIS’ written request, will electronically transmit to FIS a copy of Consultant’s latest SOC 2 report. 26. Subcontractors. Consultant will not utilize any Contractor to perform Services or provide any part of the Deliverable, without the prior written consent of FIS. Consultant will notify FIS of its intention to so engage another party not less than thirty (30) days prior to the entity commencing performance of any Services or to provide any part of the Deliverable. Consultant will provide such information and documentation concerning any such proposed party as FIS requests. Consultant will ensure that any such Contractor complies with all obligations of Consultant under the Agreement. Consultant is responsible for all of its obligations under the Agreement regardless of where performed or whether performed by any Contractor, and Consultant will be liable for the acts and omissions of any Contractor that Consultant uses to perform Services or provide any part of the Deliverable. 27. Force Majeure. 27.1 Except as expressly provided otherwise in the Agreement, and subject to the notification requirements below, the date by which a party is required to perform an obligation under the Agreement will be postponed automatically for the period of time that the performance is delayed by reason of a Force Majeure Event, exclusive of any delay the party could have avoided by reasonable precautions against the Force Majeure Event or by best efforts to work around its inability to perform or restore its ability to perform. 27.2 If a Force Majeure Event delays or threatens to delay a party’s performance of an obligation under the Agreement, the party will immediately notify the other party (i) in detail of the delay or anticipated delay and (ii) of any material changes in the circumstances of the delay, including the end of the cause for the delay. 27.3 A party whose performance is prevented by a Force Majeure Event will use its best efforts to perform in a timely manner, utilizing all resources reasonably required in the circumstances including, without limitation, obtaining reasonably available supplies and services from other resources. 27.4 This Section 27 does not relieve Consultant from its obligations to maintain and test disaster recovery plans for the Services. If a Force Majeure Event delays Consultant’s performance for more than two (2) business days then FIS may terminate the Engagement Document pursuant to Section 14.2 above, and no excuse of a performance delay due to a Force Majeure Event will preclude FIS from exercising such termination right. 28. Business Continuity Plan and Disaster Recovery. To the extent applicable to the Services under an Engagement Document, Consultant will establish and maintain disaster recovery and business continuity plans designed to minimize the risks associated with a disaster affecting Consultant’s ability to provide the Services, which includes off-site data storage and recovery infrastructure. Consultant’s recovery time objective for the Services (“RTO”) under such plan shall be set forth in the applicable Engagement Document. Consultant will maintain adequate backup procedures in order to recover FIS’ or if applicable any Client’s data to the point of the last available Master Consulting Services Agreement - General Terms Page 16 DocuSign Envelope ID: C85D0842-346C-4605-ACBC-7B5083CA7A8E good backup. Consultant’s recovery point objective (“RPO”) under such plan shall be set forth in the applicable Engagement Document. Consultant will test its disaster recovery and business continuity plans, including call trees, not less frequently than annually, will annually provide to FIS disaster recovery and business continuity plans test results. If Consultant fails to meet the RTO and RPO in any annual test, Consultant shall perform a root cause analysis of the cause of the failure to meet the RTO or RPO and will remediate the cause of such failure and retest within six (6) months of the failed test. If Consultant fails to meet the RTO or RPO in the retest, Consultant will have a second six (6) month period to remediate and retest. If provider fails a second time, FIS may request that the parties attempt to reach a mutually agreeable resolution, and if the parties are unable to agree upon a resolution within thirty (30) days of FIS’ request, FIS may terminate the Agreement or the applicable Engagement Document with no further financial obligation to Consultant. Consultant will provide its disaster recovery plan and test results to FIS and FIS may share such disaster recovery plan and test results with Clients who have contracted for the Services, if any, FIS’ auditors, and FIS’ regulators. Consultant will implement the applicable disaster recovery or business continuity plan upon the occurrence of a disaster, and shall notify FIS promptly following such event. In the event of a disaster (as defined in the plan), Consultant will not charge fees higher than or in addition to the agreed fees under the Agreement. Consultant will notify of, and invite FIS to participate in (at no additional charge to FIS), Consultant’s disaster recovery and business continuity plan test. 29. Miscellaneous. 29.1 Consultant will not subcontract, assign, subrogate or transfer any interest, obligation or right under the Agreement without the prior written consent from FIS. Any dissolution, merger, consolidation, reorganization or transfer of a majority of the assets or stock of Consultant will constitute an attempted assignment of the Agreement. Subject to the foregoing, the Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their successors or assigns. Consultant agrees that (a) any FIS Affiliate may obtain Services under the Agreement to the same extent as FIS has the right to do so, so long as it continues to be an FIS Affiliate, and (b) each FIS Affiliate is an intended, third party beneficiary of the Agreement and is entitled to rely upon all rights, representations and warranties made by Consultant herein to the same extent as if the FIS Affiliate were FIS hereunder. 29.2 The failure of either party to insist upon the performance of any terms or conditions of the Agreement, or to exercise any right or privilege conferred herein or therein, or to demand any relief at law or equity as a result of any breach hereof or thereof, will not be construed as the waiver or relinquishment of any such terms, conditions, damages, rights or privileges. No waiver of rights under the Agreement will be effective unless made in writing and signed by the party to be charged. No waiver of a breach of the Agreement will constitute a waiver of any prior or subsequent breach. 29.3 The parties hereto agree to perform all acts and execute all supplementary instruments or documents which may be necessary or desirable to carry out the provisions of the Agreement. 29.4 The division of the Agreement into sections, clauses, paragraphs or subdivisions, and the insertion of headings, are for convenience and reference only and will not affect the construction or interpretation of the provisions of the Agreement, and will not limit or extend its scope. In addition, the Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, and all of which will constitute one and the same instrument. 29.5 Consultant will not use FIS’ names, logos, trademarks or stock exchange ticker symbol, or in connection with the Agreement, those of any Client, unless pre-approved in writing by FIS. Consultant will not make any press release or other similar communication that mentions or implies a relationship between Consultant and FIS, or between Consultant and a Client in connection with the Agreement, unless pre-approved in writing by FIS. 29.6 The Agreement constitutes the entire understanding of the parties with respect to its subject matter and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings between the parties in their entirety. In the event of a conflict between these General Terms and the Agreement, these General Terms will prevail except to the extent the Engagement Document expressly modifies or removes any provision by specific reference(s) to the modified or removed provision(s). 29.7 The Agreement will not be construed more strongly against either party regardless of who is more responsible for its preparation. 29.8 If there is a conflict between a part of the Agreement and any present or future Law, the Agreement will be curtailed only to the extent necessary to bring it within the requirements of that Law. 29.9 English will be the language of the Agreement. Translation of the Agreement, its schedules, correspondence, documents, invoices, notices or other communications related to the Agreement, or the transactions thereunder, into another language will be at the sole risk of the translating party. In the event any conflicts arise between the English version of the Agreement and a translated version, the English version will prevail. If permitted under local Law, all communications pursuant to the Agreement will be conducted in the English language. Unless Master Consulting Services Agreement - General Terms Page 17 DocuSign Envelope ID: C85D0842-346C-4605-ACBC-7B5083CA7A8E the context clearly indicates otherwise, (i) references to a party’s agreement, consent, notice, request or approval mean written and signed agreement, consent, notice or approval, (ii) the words “will” and “shall” have the same meaning, which is obligatory, and (iii) the word “including” mean “including, without limitation” (so that it does not limit the scope of the word or phrase to which it is applied). 29.10 The Agreement may only be modified by written agreement of all parties. 29.11 Any provision of the Agreement which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction will, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or un-enforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions of the Agreement, and no such prohibition or un-enforceability in any jurisdiction will invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction. 29.12 The effectiveness of the Agreement, or of any Engagement Document made under the Agreement, will not be conditioned upon FIS becoming bound by (i) a reference in the Engagement Document to one or more documents maintained by Consultant and made available to FIS at a web page, by email distribution, or in any other manner or (ii) a “click-through”, “shrink wrap” or similar mechanism presented by Consultant (whether in the past, present or future) that involves the use of an action other than actual signature or electronic signature (as recognized by Law) to cause agreement to terms and conditions presented by Consultant. The parties understand and agree that any such documents, terms and conditions will be only for (A) informational purposes or to set forth obligations of or rights granted by the Consultant or its Affiliates, (B) that neither FIS nor any FIS Affiliate will be bound by any contractual obligation that might otherwise arise from any such reference or mechanism, whether under or in connection with the Agreement or otherwise, and (C) that any such documents, terms and conditions will in any event be subject to this Agreement. 29.13 The rights and obligations set forth in Section 3 (Fees and Other Payments), Section 9 (Safety and Security), Section 10 (Safeguarding of Information), Section 11 (Limitation of Liability), Section 13 (Indemnification), Section 17 (Compliance with Laws) and Section 20 (Alternative Dispute Resolution) of these General Terms, and those provisions of these General Terms which by their express terms extend beyond expiration of the Term or termination of the Engagement, or which by their nature so extend, will survive and continue in full force and effect after the expiration of the Term or the termination of the Engagement. Master Consulting Services Agreement - General Terms Page 18 DocuSign Envelope ID: C85D0842-346C-4605-ACBC-7B5083CA7A8E APPENDIX A - DATA PROTECTION ADDENDUM This Data Protection Addendum (the “Addendum”) is between [FIS entity] (“FIS”) acting on its own and as agent for the FIS Affiliates and [Provider entity] (“Provider”) acting on its own and as agent for the Provider Affiliates. The Addendum forms part of any written or electronic agreement(s) between Provider or an Provider Affiliate and FIS or a FIS Affiliate for the purchase of technology services pursuant to which Provider or an Provider Affiliate processes Personal Data for which FIS or a FIS Affiliate qualifies as a Controller (the “Agreement(s)“). The Addendum sets out obligations of FIS and Provider with respect to data protection in relation to the Agreement(s). FIS enters into this Addendum on behalf of itself and, to the extent required under applicable Data Protection Legislation, in the name and on behalf of its FIS Affiliates, if and to the extent Provider or an Provider Affiliate processes Personal Data for which such FIS Affiliates qualify as the Controller. For the purposes of this Addendum only, and except where indicated otherwise, the term \"FIS\" shall include FIS and FIS Affiliates and the term “Provider” shall include Provider and\/or where applicable Provider Affiliates. The parties hereto agree as follows: Definitions “Data Protection Legislation\" means GDPR and any legislation and\/or regulation implementing or made pursuant to them, or which amends, replaces, re-enacts or consolidates any of them, and all other applicable laws relating to Processing of Personal Data and privacy that may exist in any relevant jurisdiction, including, where applicable, the guidance and codes of practice issued by supervisory authorities; \"FIS Affiliate\" means an entity that owns or controls, is owned or controlled by or is or under common control or ownership with FIS, where control is defined as the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of an entity, whether through ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise; “Data” means any information or data to be processed by Provider pursuant to the Agreement(s) including any Personal Data, if applicable; \"Provider Affiliate\" means an entity: (a) that Processes Personal Data for which FIS or a FIS Affiliate qualifies as a Controller; and (b) which owns or controls, is owned or controlled by or is or under common control or ownership with Provider, where control is defined as the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of an entity, whether through ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise; “GDPR” means the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (Regulation (EU) 2016\/679); “Services” means technology services provided by Provider to FIS pursuant to an Agreement(s); “Standard Contractual Clauses” means the contractual clauses set out in EU Commission Decision C(2010)593 Standard Contractual Clauses (processors) for the purposes of Article 26(2) of Directive 95\/46\/EC (as amended and revised from time to time); The terms, “Controller\", \"Data Subject\", \"Personal Data\", \"Processing\" and “Processor” shall have the same meaning as in the GDPR, and their related terms shall be construed accordingly. Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the respective Agreement(s). Clauses 1. In the course of Provider providing the Services under the Agreement(s), FIS may from time-to-time provide or make available Data to Provider. The parties acknowledge and agree that, in relation to any Personal Data provided or made available to Provider for Processing by FIS under the Agreement(s), FIS will be the Controller and Provider will be a Processor for the purposes of the GDPR. 2. The Agreement(s) determines the subject matter and the duration of Provider’s Processing of Personal Data, as well as the nature and purpose of any collection, use and other Processing of Personal Data and the rights and obligations of FIS. Appendix 1 sets out the categories of Data Subjects and Personal Data Processed. 3. As required under the applicable Data Protection Legislation, the parties agree to incorporate the Standard Contractual Clauses into this Addendum, including the information set out in Annex 1 which is to be incorporated into such Standard Contractual Clauses for the purposes of this Addendum. In the event that the European Commission, any applicable data protection authority, or other body with competent authority and jurisdiction and\/or the analogous competent authority in the United Kingdom revises and thereafter publishes new Standard Contractual Clauses or as Master Consulting Services Agreement - General Terms Page 19 DocuSign Envelope ID: C85D0842-346C-4605-ACBC-7B5083CA7A8E otherwise required or implemented by such authority, such new Standard Contractual Clauses will supersede and replace the existing Standard Contractual Clauses. The European Economic Area (“EEA”) member state or the United Kingdom, as the case may be, where the data exporter is established shall be deemed inserted in Clause 9 and Clause 11 at the appropriate places, and the definition of “applicable data protection laws” shall be replaced with “with respect to any particular Data, the European Economic Area (EEA) member state, Swiss or United Kingdom legislation protecting the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals and in particular, their right to privacy with respect to the Processing of Personal Data, which is applicable to the Data Exporter.” Except as covered or permitted by the Standard Contractual Clauses, applicable law, or a country in respect of which a valid adequacy decision has been issued by the European Commission, as the case may be, Provider shall not Process Personal Data outside the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom. Subject to the last sentence hereof, the Standard Contractual Clauses shall also apply in relation to the Processing of Personal Data that is transferred from the EEA by FIS to Provider in the United Kingdom if the United Kingdom is neither: (a) subject to a transitional arrangement allowing the transfer of Personal Data to continue from the EEA to the United Kingdom without appropriate safeguards; (b) recognized by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of protection for Personal Data; nor (c) covered by an alternative framework recognized by the relevant authorities or the courts as providing an adequate level of protection for Personal Data.

Provider shall Process the Personal Data only in accordance with the written instructions given by FIS from time to time as documented in and in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and not for any other purposes, particularly not for the Provider’s own purposes. Provider shall notify the FIS and the relevant FIS Affiliates immediately if, in the Provider's opinion, an instruction for the Processing of Personal Data given by FIS or the relevant FIS Affiliate infringes the GDPR or any other applicable Data Protection Legislation. 5. Provider shall ensure that all persons it authorizes to access the Personal Data have committed themselves to confidentiality in writing or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality. 6. Provider may not engage sub-Processors under the Agreement or give access to or transfer any Personal Data to any third party (including any affiliates, group companies or sub-contractors) without the prior written consent of FIS and the relevant FIS Affiliates. If FIS consents to the use of third parties as sub-Processors Provider shall (i) impose in writing upon such sub-Processors the same data protection obligations as set out herein and as are required by applicable Data Protection Legislation and (ii) be responsible for the acts and omissions of such sub  Processors under the Agreement. Where prior written consent given by FIS pursuant to this clause authorises a class of third party to Process Personal Data, the Provider shall notify FIS of any intended changes concerning the addition or replacement of any sub-Processors within such class, and FIS shall have the right to object to, and prevent, any such addition or replacement of sub-Processors within such class. 7. Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of Processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, Provider shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. As a minimum, these should include the requirements required under applicable Data Protection Legislation and the requirements set out in the Agreement. Upon request, Provider shall provide a written description of the technical and organizational measures the Provider employs for Processing Personal Data. 8. Provider shall take reasonable steps to ensure that any natural person acting under its authority who has access to Personal Data does not Process them except on instructions from it. 9. Upon FIS’s written request, Provider shall (at FIS’s choice) delete or return all Personal Data Processed on behalf of FIS to FIS after the end of the provision of Services relating to Processing, subject to Provider retaining any copies required by applicable EU member state law. 10. Provider shall cooperate with FIS as reasonably requested by FIS in order to assist FIS with its compliance with its legal obligations under Chapter III and pursuant to Articles 32 to 36 of the GDPR. 11. If Provider becomes aware of or has reason to assume any breach of security that has led to or is likely to lead to the accidental, unauthorized or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, or disclosure of, or access to the Personal Data that Provider Processes for FIS, Provider shall immediately (a) notify FIS thereof with all details describing the nature and cause of the breach, the affected type of Personal Data, the number of individuals possibly affected and the potential consequences; (b) at its own expense investigate the breach and to identify, prevent and mitigate the effects of the breach; and Master Consulting Services Agreement - General Terms Page 20 DocuSign Envelope ID: C85D0842-346C-4605-ACBC-7B5083CA7A8E (c) with the prior written approval of FIS, carry out any recovery or other action necessary to remedy the breach. Provider shall not release or publish any filing, communication, notice, press release, or report concerning the breach without FIS’ prior written approval (except where required to do so by law). 12.
