Ae Care Executive 2 Generation of Fault Ticket No The Helpdesk will enter the details in the fault management system and inform to the FIS about the following: Fault ticket No Expected Restoration Time Note 3: The Expected Restoration Time (ERT) will be reported within half an hour of the FIS complaint with cause of failure. Care Executive 3 Updates to FIS Update to the FIS will be given 15 minutes before expiry of ERT. care Executive 4 Escalation of Complaint (By FIS) The FIS is free to escalate to relevant CTRL S personnel in case FIS care does not revert, as per Matrix enclosed. Care Executive 5 Ticket Closure Once the fault has been corrected, Helpdesk will contact the FIS to ensure that he is satisfied with service restoration. The fault ticket will be closed in accordance with the FIS's verbal acceptance of satisfactory closure. Care Executive Typical risks and dependencies faced in Datacenter Transformation & Migration Project: Risk & Dependencies Mitigations Initial capital Cost Implementing a private cloud in the organization will require a significant entry cost to satisfy the needs of virtualization and the management layers that compose the fabric to deploy, operate, and monitor the environment. These costs must be realized in each step of the deployment process from prototyping to production. Overtime these costs will turn to cost benefits as shared resource usage wins over traditional forms of resource allocation on a per application instance basis. Security Designing for a secure environment is always a challenge as new threats continue to emerge on a regular basis. Private clouds mitigate many of these attack surfaces since the entire operation is in-house, however organizational concerns still exist when meeting compliance requirements. Compliance n any IT organization the goals of IT must be met while maintaining conformance to organizational and regulatory compliance requirements Technology Partners Competency of technology partners having the right set of skills, experience tools and delivery engine to drive large transformation projects plays a vital role for the success of projects AIDM- Application to Infrastructure Dependency Matrix Our experience has shown that most of the datacenter project has been delayed as AIDM was not studied and analyzed Continuity of Operations No matter how robust the plan may look on paper but during delivery and execution unforeseen issues and dependencies can stall the project; hence DR and backup needs to factored for high-risk change implementations. We suggest DR to be enabled to undertake any adversity CtrlS shall ensure continuity of business and IT operations for FIS and hence high level critical primary datacenter implementation and migration phase should have a tested Disaster Recovery System in place to address all such eventualities covered in CtrlS Scope 5.

Master Services Agreement This MASTER SERVICES AGREEMENT (this “MSA”) is entered into by and between Cologix US, Inc. with offices located at 225 E.16th Avenue, Suite 900, Denver, Colorado 80203 (“Cologix”) and Fidelity Information Services, LLC with offices located at 601 Riverside Avenue, Jacksonville, Florida 32204 (“Customer”), and is binding as of the latest dated signature below and has an effective date of April 1, 2019 (the “Effective Date”). This MSA consists of and is subject to the general terms and conditions set forth in this MSA and all Schedules and Service Orders (each as defined below) that are attached to this MSA or are subsequently entered into by the parties hereto (collectively, the “Agreement”). 1. Services. Cologix provides the services (“Services”), in accordance with the general terms and conditions set forth in this MSA, as well as the terms and conditions set forth on the schedule(s) referencing this MSA, and attached hereto or executed hereafter (each, a “Schedule”). This Agreement shall apply to all Services provided to Customer by Cologix. 2. Service Orders. Cologix will perform the Services specified in any written order between Cologix and Customer that is signed by both parties or, with respect to cross-connects only, any email order that is sent by Customer and confirmed by Cologix via email (each, a “Service Order”). Each Service Order shall identify the Services to be provided by Cologix to Customer, the recurring charges, which shall not be subject to change under the terms of the Service Order, other than as set forth in this Section 2, and any non-recurring charges for such Services and the term during which such Services are to be provided. Service Orders under this MSA may be entered into and performed by Cologix and\/or any of its Affiliates (as defined below), including an Affiliate authorized to provide Service(s) in a country or jurisdiction other than the country or jurisdiction within which this MSA has been executed. As used herein, “Affiliate” shall mean any entity controlled by, controlling or under common control with the applicable party. 3. Representations and Warranties. a. Cologix represents, covenants and warrants to Customer that Cologix: (i) has the authority to enter into the Agreement and the Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Cologix that does not violate any other agreement between Cologix and any other person, (ii) will provide the Services in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations; and (iii) Cologix will perform the Services in a workmanlike manner. b. Customer represents, covenants and warrants to Cologix that Customer: (i) has the authority to enter into the Agreement and the Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Customer that does not violate any other agreement between Customer and any other person, (ii) will use the Service(s) in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations; and (iii) will comply with Cologix’s Policies and Procedures: Facility User Guide, a current copy of which is attached hereto, as reasonably amended from time to time (“Policies and Procedures”), by publishing at www.cologix.com and posting at Cologix’s facilities. With respect to any significant modifications to the Policies and Procedures, Cologix will provide not less than sixty (60) days’ prior notice to Customer of such modifications (which may be sent by email). In addition to the foregoing, Customer hereby represents, warrants and covenants to Cologix that if Customer is handling “protected health information” or, if Customer is a “covered entity”, in each case, as such term is defined by The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (as the same may be amended, “HIPAA”), then, to the extent any data is moving through a Cologix facility, Customer will, at all times during the term of this MSA, ensure that such data is encrypted in transmission and otherwise employ administrative and technical safeguards to protect and secure any such “protected health information” as required under applicable HiPaA regulations. c. If Customer intends to resell or sublicense the Service(s), Customer further covenants that Customer (i) Customer will remain liable for the payment of all charges due under each Service Order and all acts or omissions of any sublicensee of Customer shall be attributable to Customer under the Agreement, and (iii) will indemnify, defend and hold Cologix harmless from claims made against Cologix by any third party that Customer resells or sublicenses the Service(s) to, except to the extent arising out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Cologix, and without limiting Customer’s rights under Section 7 hereof. d. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THE AGREEMENT, NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE BY COLOGIX, AND COLOGIX EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR WARRANTIES ARISING FROM A COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE OR TRADE PRACTICE. CUSTOMER IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR AND COLOGIX EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND LIABILITIES OF ANY KIND RELATING TO CUSTOMER’S SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE, INCLUDING THIRD- PARTY SOFTWARE AND\/OR HARDWARE LICENSED BY CUSTOMER. 4. Billing; Payment of Invoices; Taxes. a. Cologix will inform Customer in writing, including, without limitation, email communication, that Customer’s ordered Service(s) are available for use by Customer (“Service Commencement Notice”). To the extent the parties have agreed in a Service Order to a specific installation date or service start date for the ordered Services thereunder, then the Service Commencement Notice shall not be delivered until such agreed installation or start date. Customer may use the period between the availability of the service and the specified installation date or service start date for installation (if any) of Customer equipment, provided that Customer shall not make operational use until the Service Commencement Date (defined below). Upon receipt of such notice, Customer shall have a period of seventy-two (72) hours to confirm that the Service(s) is properly functioning. Unless Customer delivers written notice to Cologix within such seventy-two (72) hour period that the Service(s) is not properly functioning, billing shall commence following the date of the Service Commencement Notice, or such later date as the Service is functioning properly (as set forth in the following sentence) (the “Service Commencement Date”), regardless of whether Customer is prepared to accept delivery of the ordered Service(s). In the event that Customer notifies Cologix within the time period stated above that the Service is not functioning properly, then Cologix shall correct any deficiencies in the Service(s) and deliver a new Service Commencement Notice to Customer, after which the process stated above will be repeated. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Customer has not provided Cologix with its final power configuration with respect to the ordered Service(s) within ten (10) business days of Customer’s execution of the applicable Service Order, Customer acknowledges that Cologix shall have the right to deliver the Service Commencement Notice and commence billing for the Service(s) despite the fact that the Service(s) are not available to Customer for Customer’s use solely as a result of the failure of Customer to provide the final power configuration. b. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Service Order, any non¬ recurring charges will be invoiced by Cologix following the installation of the Services set forth in the applicable Service Order. Recurring charges will be billed monthly in advance, except for charges that are dependent upon usage of Services, which are billed in arrears. Billing for partial months will be prorated based on a calendar month. c. All amounts payable under the Agreement shall be payable in full within forty-five (45) days of the date of invoice (the “Grace Period”), in United States dollars, unless otherwise specified in the applicable Service Order. Cologix reserves the right to charge a late fee of 1.0% per month or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is less, calculated from the end of the Grace Period. In addition to the foregoing, if Customer fails to make payment of undisputed amounts within the Grace Period, then Cologix reserves right, upon written notice to Customer and an additional thirty (30) days following the date of such notice for Customer to cure the failure to pay, to suspend the performance of the Service(s), and\/or refuse to provide any new Service(s) requested by Customer, none of which shall constitute a constructive eviction hereunder. In addition to the foregoing, Customer agrees that it shall not be permitted to remove its equipment from the Cologix facility during any cure period under this clause (c), other than in connection with the replacement, repair, maintenance and operation of Customer’s equipment in the ordinary course. d. If Customer reasonably disputes an invoice, Customer must pay the undisputed amount before the expiration of the Grace Period and submit written notice of the disputed amount, within forty-five (45) days of the date of the disputed invoice (with details of the nature of the dispute and the Service(s) and invoice(s) disputed). If the dispute is resolved against Customer, Customer shall pay the disputed amount plus interest from the date originally due. e. Cologix reserves the right to require a deposit or another form of security, at any time when Customer’s payment history under any Service Order does not conform to this Section 4 or Customer has an Insolvency Event (as defined below). As used herein, “Insolvency Event” means making a general assignment for the benefit of a party’s creditors, filing a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or any petition or answer seeking, consenting to, or acquiescing in reorganization or similar relief or an involuntary petition in bankruptcy or other insolvency protection is filed against the applicable party and not dismissed within 60 days. The acceptance and deposit by Cologix of any payment from Customer that contains reference of any type that such payment constitutes “payment in full” shall not constitute an accord and satisfaction or a waiver by Cologix of any right(s) it possesses, in law or equity, to collect payment in full from Customer for any and all Services provided to Customer under the Agreement. f. All charges for Service(s) are exclusive of applicable taxes and fees. Except for taxes based on Cologix’s net income, payroll and property, Customer shall be responsible for all governmental taxes and fees that arise in any jurisdiction, however designated, imposed on, or based upon the provision, sale or use of, the Service(s) (collectively, the “Taxes”). Customer shall indemnify, defend and hold Cologix harmless from costs, expenses, and penalties incurred by Cologix to the extent arising from, Customer’s non-payment of any such Taxes. If Customer is entitled to an exemption from any Taxes, Customer is required to present Cologix with a valid exemption certificate (in a form reasonably acceptable to Cologix). Cologix will give effect to any valid exemption certificate provided by Customer in accordance with the foregoing sentence to the extent it applies to any Service billed by Cologix to Customer following Cologix’s receipt of such exemption certificate. 5. Term, Termination; Expiration. a. The term of this MSA shall continue for so long as there is any Service Order outstanding. Either party shall have the right to terminate this MSA, upon written notice to the other party, if no Service Order is then outstanding. With respect to each Service Order, unless otherwise specified in a Service Order, all Service Orders shall continue for the term set forth thereon (the “Service Term”). Upon the expiration of the Service Term, Customer shall have four (4) options to renew the term of each Service Order for one (1) year each (each, a “Renewal Term”); provided, that (i) Customer provides Cologix with written notice of b. Customer’s desire to renew the Service Term of a Service Order for the applicable Renewal Term at least ninety (90) days prior to the end of the then current term thereof, (ii) no event of default under the Agreement has occurred and is continuing at the time of Customer’s notice to Cologix or on the commencement of the applicable Renewal Term and (iii) with respect to the second, third and\/or fourth Renewal Terms with respect to a Service Order, the first, second and\/or third Renewal Term (as applicable) has been validly exercised by Customer hereunder. The parties agree that the monthly recurring charges due and owing during each Renewal Term of any Service Order shall be an amount equal to one hundred three percent (103%) of the monthly recurring charges due in connection with such Service Order for the immediately preceding year. Either party may terminate the Agreement or any Service Order, (i) if the other party fails to perform or breaches any material term or condition of the Agreement (other than as provided below) and does not cure such breach within thirty (30) days (ten (10) days for late payment of fees) following the receipt of a written notice from the non¬ breaching party specifying the nature of the breach in reasonable detail and stating such party’s intention to terminate the Agreement and\/or Service Order, as applicable; or (ii) the other party has had an Insolvency Event. Other than as expressly provided in the Agreement, neither party shall have the right to terminate the Agreement or any Service Order during a term. Customer shall have the right to terminate the Agreement or any Service Order for convenience prior to the end of the applicable term thereof, provided that to effect such termination Customer shall be required to provide not less than ninety (90) days’ prior written notice to Cologix of such termination, and, provided further that prior to the effective date of such termination (and prior to Customer’s removal of its equipment and personal property from the applicable Cologix facility), Customer shall pay to Cologix, as liquidated damages, a termination fee in an amount equal to (i) with respect to any termination during months 1 through 12 (inclusive) of the term of a Service Order, one hundred percent (100%) of the monthly recurring charges due under such terminated Service Order for the remainder of the term of such Service Order, (ii) with respect to any termination during months 13 through 24 (inclusive) of the term of a Service Order, seventy-five percent (75%) of the monthly recurring charges due under such terminated Service Order for the remainder of the term of such Service Order, (iii) with respect to any termination during months 25 through 36 (inclusive) of the term of a Service Order, fifty percent (50%) of the monthly recurring charges due under such terminated Service Order for the remainder of the term of such Service Order, (iv) with respect to any termination during months 37 through 48 (inclusive) of the term of a Service Order, twenty-five percent (25%) of the monthly recurring charges due under such terminated Service Order for the remainder of the term of such Service Order, and (v) for any remaining term of a Service Order after the fourth year, there shall be no termination fee due. The foregoing shall not include any Customer usage charges for power under a Service Order. The failure to pay amounts owed under a Service Order when due shall be considered a material breach of the Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, other than the termination right set forth in Section 16 hereof (if applicable), Customer’s sole remedies for Service outages, failures or defects are contained in any service level agreement(s) (“SLAs”) included in any Schedule (which may include chronic outage or other termination rights as set forth therein), if any; provided, however, that with respect to any Service that does not have an SLA associated with it set forth in the applicable Schedule, if such Service experiences three (3) or more outages, or a single outage exceeding 12 hours in length, in each case which adversely impacts Customer’s ability to provide services to its clients or operate its business, then Customer shall have the right, as its sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any such 2 Service outage, to terminate the affected Service without any early termination liability or other penalty. c. Within fifteen (15) days after expiration, or the earlier termination, of the Agreement or any Service Order, Customer shall remove all of its equipment and other personal property (which shall include any hardware or software licensed by Customer from a third party) from Cologix’s facility(ies); provided, however, that Customer shall continue to pay Cologix for all monthly recurring charges relating to the terminated or expired Service Order(s) during such fifteen (15) day period at the same rate in effect under the terminated or expired Service Order immediately prior to the termination or expiration thereof. If Customer fails to remove its equipment or other personal property, Cologix may, without prior notice to Customer, disconnect, remove and dispose of Customer’s equipment or other personal property at Customer’s expense. Other than (i) where Customer has terminated a Service Order for convenience pursuant to Section 5(b) above or (ii) where Cologix has terminated a Service Order due to Customer’s uncured breach hereunder, upon the termination of a Service Order, Cologix and Customer shall reasonably cooperate, in good faith to allow for the orderly and expeditious removal of Customer’s equipment from the applicable Cologix facility and migration of the applicable Service(s) (the “Transition”), provided that this sentence shall not be interpreted to permit a holdover by Customer of the Customer Space or Services at the end of any term beyond the period specified herein. Customer shall pay Cologix at its then current remote hands rates for any assistance by Cologix during a Transition. 6. Limitation of Liability. Except where a party has an indemnification obligation to the other party or where such party has acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct, in no event will either party be liable to the other party for any indirect, consequential, incidental, special or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of use, interruption of business, loss of data or loss of profits (other than where the parties mutually agree that such damages are direct damages and not indirect, consequential, incidental or punitive damages or where a court of competent jurisdiction has determined that such damages are direct damages and not indirect, consequential, incidental or punitive) , arising out of or in any way connected with the Agreement or the Services, even if the relevant party has been advised of the possibility of such damages. 7. Indemnification. Each party agrees to indemnify the other party, its Affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, members, shareholders, employees, agents, assigns and successors, and shall hold them harmless against any losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) resulting from a third party claim, arising out of or alleged to have arisen out of, (a) such party’s breach of its obligations, representations or warranties under the Agreement or (b) bodily injury, death or property damage caused by such party. The indemnified party agrees to give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any such claim; provided, that any delay in furnishing such notice shall not discharge the indemnifying party from its indemnification obligation hereunder, except to the extent such delay results in actual prejudice to the indemnifying party. The indemnifying party shall undertake and conduct the defense of any claim so brought. The indemnifying party shall keep the indemnified party advised of the progress of any such claim and the indemnified party shall have the right to monitor, at such party’s election, such claim at its own expense. If the indemnifying party shall fail to take timely action to defend any such claim then the indemnified party may defend such claim at the indemnifying party’s expense. The indemnifying party shall not have the right to settle, compromise or otherwise enter into any agreement regarding the disposition of any claim without the indemnified party’s prior written consent, which may not be unreasonably withheld, except for the settlement of a claim solely for monetary damages. 8. Insurance. a. Customer agrees to keep in full force and effect during the term of the Agreement: (a) commercial general liability insurance, including contractual liability insurance, in an amount not less than One Million Dollars $1,000,000 per occurrence, providing for the investigation, defense and satisfaction (by settlement or otherwise) of any claim under the Agreement, (b) comprehensive automobile liability insurance with a limit of not less than $1,000,000 per occurrence for bodily injury, $500,000 per person and $100,000 property damage or a combined single limit of $1,000,000 for both owned and non-owned vehicles, (c) umbrella coverage with a limit of not less than $5,000,000 per occurrence, (d) “Special Causes of Loss” Property insurance covering all of Customer’s personal property located at any of Cologix’s facilities, (e) commercial crime insurance including employee dishonesty coverage in an amount of at least One Million Dollars ($1,000,000); and (f) workers’ compensation insurance in an amount not less than that required by applicable law and Employer’s Liability with limits of at least Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000). Customer acknowledges that (x) it retains the risk of loss for, or damage to, its equipment and other personal property located at any of Cologix’s facilities unless caused by the gross negligence of Cologix, and (y) Cologix’s insurance policies do not provide coverage for Customer’s equipment or other personal property. Customer’s general liability policy shall indicate that insurer provides the primary, non-contributory insurance for any claims for which Customer is liable under the Agreement. Each of Customer’s general liability policy and property insurance policy shall include a provision denying insurer subrogation rights against Cologix and the Cologix indemnitees, except in the event of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Cologix or a Cologix indemnitee. Customer shall cause the insurance company issuing such policies to issue a certificate to Cologix confirming that such policies are in full force and effect and provide coverage to Cologix and the Cologix indemnitees as additional insureds on the general liability, Automobile liability, and umbrella liability only. Customer shall either (1) require any contractor, customer or other third party entering a Cologix facility on Customer’s behalf to procure and maintain the same types, amounts and coverage extensions as required of Customer in clauses (a) and (e) above or (2) ensure that Customer’s insurance provides full coverage for the acts or omissions of any such third party entering a Cologix facility on Customer’s behalf. The carrying of the above-described coverage will in no way be interpreted as relieving Customer of any other responsibility or liability under the Agreement or any applicable law, statute, regulation or order. b. During the term of the Agreement, Cologix will keep in full force and effect: (a) Commercial General Liability Insurance including Premises & Operations, Products\/Completed Operations, Contractual, Broad Form Property Damage, and Bodily Injury with a combined single limit of at least One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) per occurrence and Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) general aggregate; (b) Umbrella (Excess) Liability Insurance: coverage in an amount of at least Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) per occurrence; (c) Property Insurance: against all risks of physical loss or damage to any property of Cologix in the full amount of the replacement cost thereof; (d) Professional Liability: in an amount of at least Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000); and (e) Commercial Crime: including employee Dishonesty coverage in an amount of at least One Million Dollars ($1,000,000). Upon Customer’s request, Cologix will provide Customer with certificates of insurance evidencing that the coverage required under this Section 8(b) are maintained in force with insurance companies that have A.M. Best ratings of at least A-(VIII). Customer will be named as an additional insured under the Commercial General Liability and Umbrella. Cologix shall cause its insurance carriers to waive subrogation with respect to its Commercial General Liability policy, except in the event of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Customer or a Customer indemnitee. The carrying of the 3 above-described coverage will in no way be interpreted as relieving Cologix of any other responsibility or liability under the Agreement or any applicable law, statute, regulation or order. 9. Confidential Information. “Confidential Information” means any information that one party receives from the other that is marked as confidential, or which by the nature of the information or the circumstances of its disclosure should be considered to be confidential or proprietary. For the avoidance of doubt, Cologix’s pricing, terms of service and audit and compliance reports are, in all instances, Confidential Information of Cologix under this Section 9. Each party agrees that it (i) will not disclose the Confidential Information of the other to any third party except as necessary to provide or receive the Services or as required by law (subject to the following sentence) and (ii) each party will take reasonable precautions to protect the confidentiality of such Confidential Information, but shall exercise no less care than it uses for its own Confidential Information. In the event that a party is required by law to make any disclosure of any Confidential Information hereunder, the receiving party shall (unless prohibited by applicable law) first give written notice of such requirement to the disclosing party and, in the event disclosure is still required (as determined by legal counsel to the receiving party), the receiving party shall only disclose that portion of the Confidential Information that is legally required to be disclosed. Each party acknowledges and agrees that damages at law may be an insufficient remedy to the disclosing party in the event that any of the covenants contained in this Section are violated. Accordingly, in addition to any other remedies or rights that may be available to the disclosing party, in the event of a breach or threatened breach of this Section 9 by the receiving party, the disclosing party shall also be entitled, upon application to a court of competent jurisdiction, to seek to obtain injunctive relief to enforce the provisions of this Section. Confidential Information shall remain the property of the party from or through whom it was provided. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Confidential Information shall not include information that: (i) was previously known to the receiving party without an obligation of confidentiality; (ii) is or becomes publicly available through no fault of the receiving party; (iii) was or is independently developed by the receiving party without use of, or reference to, any Confidential Information; (iv) is released for disclosure with the written consent of the disclosing party; or (v) is received from a third party to whom it was disclosed without obligations of confidentiality. Upon termination of the Agreement or earlier upon a party’s request, each party shall destroy the other party’s Confidential Information in a manner designed to preserve its confidentiality, or, at the other party’s written request and expense, return it to the disclosing party. 10. Publicity. Neither party shall use the other’s logo, name, trademark or other mark in any way except as necessary to provide services hereunder, without first obtaining the other party’s prior written consent. 11. Relationship of Parties. Nothing in the Agreement will be construed to imply a joint venture, partnership or agency relationship between the parties, and Cologix will be considered an independent contractor when performing Service(s) under the Agreement. 12. Assignment. Customer may not assign the Agreement without Cologix’s prior written consent. 13. No Third Party Beneficiaries. No provisions of the Agreement are intended to, or shall be construed to, confer upon any person, other than the parties hereto, any rights, remedies or other benefits under or by reason of the Agreement. 14. Notices. All notices required or permitted hereunder must be given in writing and, except for routine notices that the parties agree to send and receive electronically, shall be considered properly and timely given if hand- delivered, mailed first class mail (postage prepaid and return receipt requested) or sent by express overnight courier at the address specified on the first page of this MSA or at such other address as a party may specify in writing pursuant to this Section. Notices to Customer shall include a copy to: Fidelity Information Services, LLC, 601 Riverside Avenue, Jacksonville, FL 32204, Attn. Chief Legal Officer. Notices to Cologix shall include a copy to: Cologix, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 225 E. 16th Avenue, Suite 900, Denver, Colorado 80203. For the purpose of determining any time period measured from the date a notice is given, all notices shall be deemed given upon the earlier of refusal of delivery or when received, as applicable. 15. Governing Law; Consent To Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial. The Agreement shall be deemed to be a contract made under, and shall be construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York (without reference to the conflicts of laws provisions therein and the federal laws of the United States). In addition, each party consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court empowered to enforce the Agreement located in New York State, and waives any objection thereto on the basis of venue. Each party waives their respective rights to trial by jury for any claim whatsoever in any way connected with the Agreement or the relationship between the parties. 16. Force Majeure. Except with respect to any payment obligations, neither party will be liable for any failure or delay in its performance under the Agreement due to extraordinary causes beyond its reasonable control. In the event that Cologix is not able to deliver any Service(s) as a result of a force majeure event, Customer shall not be obligated to pay Cologix for the affected Service(s) for so long as Cologix is unable to deliver the affected Service(s). If an event of force majeure continues for more than seven (7) consecutive days, the party not claiming force majeure may terminate the affected Services, without penalty. 17. Waiver. No waiver will be effective unless documented in a writing signed by an authorized representative of the party against which enforcement of the waiver is sought. The failure of either party to insist upon strict performance of any of the terms or provisions of the Agreement, or the exercise of any option, right or remedy contained herein, shall not be construed as a waiver of any future application of such term, provision, option, right or remedy, and such term, provision, option, right or remedy shall continue and remain in full force and effect. 18. Survival. Any term or provision of the Agreement which, by its nature and context, should reasonably be expected to survive the expiration or earlier termination of the Agreement, shall so survive such expiration or termination thereof. 19. Prevailing Party. In the event of a dispute arising from or related to the Agreement, the substantially prevailing party shall be entitled to recovery of all reasonable costs incurred, including, without limitation, court costs, attorneys’ fees and other related costs and expenses. 20. Counterparts; Electronic Copies. This MSA and any Schedule or Service Order may be executed in counterparts which, when taken together, shall constitute one and the same document. In addition, each party hereby agrees that facsimile, photographic or electronic copies of any of the foregoing shall be deemed an original thereof. Finally, each party hereby consents to the use of electronic signatures, including via Adobe e-signature or a similar product or service, and acknowledge and agree that no electronic record or signature shall be challenged or denied legal effect or enforceability because it is in electronic form. 21. Severability. If any term or provision of the Agreement shall be declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, unenforceable or otherwise ineffective, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Agreement shall otherwise remain in 4 full force and effect and enforceable. If the surviving portions of the Agreement fail to retain the essential understanding of the parties, the Agreement shall be terminated by the mutual consent of the parties. 22. Headings. Heading are for ease of reference only and shall not have any effect upon the construction of the Agreement. 23. Construction. The parties agree that each party has reviewed and revised the Agreement and that the normal rule of construction to the effect that any ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party shall not be employed in the interpretation of the Agreement. 24. Entire Agreement; Modification; Order of Precedence. As of the Effective Date, the Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties relating to its subject matter and the Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings between the parties, oral or written, with respect to its subject matter and may not be changed unless mutually agreed upon in a writing signed by both parties. In case of a conflict between any of the terms and conditions in this MSA and any other terms and conditions in any Schedule or Service Order, the order of precedence shall be: any Schedule, this MSA and the Service Order. For the avoidance of doubt, any purchase order sent to Cologix by Customer (for Customer’s administrative purposes or otherwise) shall not be binding, and no term in a Service Order other than those provided in Section 2 shall be binding on either party. a. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties intend that, as of the Effective Date, (i) this MSA and the attached Colocation Services Schedule will replace and supersede, in full, that certain Master Services Agreement and Colocation Services Schedule (together with the Rider annexed thereto), each dated as of August 26, 2014 (collectively, the “Prior Agreement”) and, from and after the Effective Date, the Prior Agreement will be of no further force or effect and (ii) Service Order numbers 20406 and 21509 (the “Renewal Service Orders”) will, collectively, renew all Services being provided by Cologix to Customer immediately prior to the Effective Date (it being agreed that the “Office Space” identified in Service Order 21509 renews all “Office Space” in prior Service Order 4238). In the event that the parties determine that there are Services being provided by Cologix to Customer immediately prior to the Effective Date that are not included in the Services being ordered in the Renewal Service Orders, Cologix shall continue to provide such services at their then-current rates during the term of the Renewal Service Orders, unless such Services are covered by the JAX2 Facility Rate Card, in which event, the pricing will be based on the JAX2 Facility Rate Card. 25. Rate Cards. Cologix and Customer may, from time to time, agree to a rate card for one or more Cologix facilities. The initial rate card for Services offered to Customer at Cologix’s facility located at 4800 Spring Park Road, Jacksonville, Florida (the “JAX2 Facility”) is attached hereto as Appendix A (the “JAX2 Facility Rate Card”). Each additional rate card, if any, shall be added hereto as an additional appendix. In the event that a rate card is in effect for a particular Cologix facility, all new Service Orders for Services identified on such rate card at such facility during the term of the applicable rate card shall be provided by Cologix to Customer at the rates set forth on the applicable rate card, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the parties hereto. Upon the expiration of any rate card, pursuant to its terms, Cologix reserves the right (but has no obligation) to replace such rate card with a revised rate card, so long as Cologix and Customer have agreed to such rate card by amendment of this MSA. If the parties are unable to agree on the replacement rate card, then no rate card shall be in effect following the expiration of the prior rate card in accordance with its terms. 26. Security. Cologix shall provide physical security within the Customer’s colocation area, which shall include at a minimum: (i) secured access to both the facility and the Customer’s colocation area with access provided only to persons who are authorized by users and in compliance with the Policies and Procedures, (ii) recorded video surveillance of the access to both the facility and the secured area. Cologix will conduct a background check on all of its personnel having access to the Customer’s colocation space under each Service Order. Upon Customer’s written request, Cologix will make available to Customer, its most recent SOC1, Type II report concerning its operations, systems, controls and procedures, in accordance with Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) No. 18 and its most recent SOC2, Type II report (or, in each case, such other similar or equivalent audits and\/or inspections). Customer acknowledges and agrees that any audit report provided by Cologix is Confidential Information of Cologix and shall be treated as such by Customer pursuant to Section 9 above. 27. Business Divestiture. In the event of a “Business Divestiture” (as such term is hereinafter defined) which includes all or any part of the Services, provided that the entity acquiring the divested business (the “Divestiture Entity”), which shall be subject to the reasonable approval of Cologix as to its financial standing, assumes in full and in writing all obligations of Customer under the Agreement in connection with such divested Services, Customer shall be released from all obligations with respect to the Services which are divested without any early termination fee or penalty. For purpose of this provision, “Business Divestiture” shall mean the sale or divestiture by Customer of a subsidiary, affiliate, business unit or operating division that uses Services hereunder. Following public announcement of such event(s), Customer shall notify Cologix upon concluding that one or more events triggering the application of this subsection has occurred and will provide Cologix with reasonable documentation of the impact of such event(s) on Customer’s Service(s), together with a copy of the assignment and assumption document between Customer and the Divestiture Entity of the divested Services and the Agreement, which shall be subject to Cologix’s reasonable approval as to form and substance. 28. Reserved. 29. Contractors. Customer shall have the right to use third party contractors to install and maintain power circuits, provided that such contractors are approved by Cologix, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and comply in all instances with Cologix’s security rules and regulations and the Policies and Procedures. Customer shall be fully responsible to Cologix for any damage or liability caused by such contractors.

Luxembourg B 192 940, whose registered office is at 63 Grand Rue, 3927 Mondercange, Luxembourg (the \"Supplier\").

DEFINITIONS AND INCORPORATION 1.1. Terms capitalised and used in this Statement of Work will have the meanings assigned to them under the Agreement. In addition, the following expression shall have the following meaning. BSP - is the central point through which data and funds flow between travel agents and airlines. Instead of every agent having an individual relationship with each airline, all of the information is consolidated through the BSP. Agents make one single payment to the BSP (remittance), covering sales on all BSP Airlines. The BSP makes one consolidated payment to each airline, covering sales made by all agents in the country\/region. Agents are provided with a range of electronic ticket numbers to be used for sales on any airline. IATA - The International Air Transport Association (IATA) is the trade association for the world's airlines, representing some 265 airlines or 83% of total air traffic. They support many areas of aviation activity and help formulate industry policy on critical aviation issues. DISH (CSI) - is the global data interchange standard implemented by all Billing Settlement Plans (BSPs), to ensure consistency and the exchange of the highest possible quality data between BSPs and GDSs, airlines and other business partners. The DISH provides the passenger travel industry with a set of standard formats to support the reporting of Passenger sales and ticketing data for settlement purposes. Please note; the file contains card details and therefore PCI-DSS is in scope. Airline Accounting\/Sales data (HOT) - The Airline Accounting\/Sales data contains all Agents' automated and manual transactions effected exclusively on behalf of one ticketing Airline during one or more reporting periods, as well as other accountable documents concerning such transactions and those of that Airline relating to prior reporting periods. Supplier - The partner that will be providing the service to Worldpay. 1.2. By executing this Statement of Work the parties agree that all of the provisions of the Agreement are expressly incorporated into this Statement of Work by reference and agree to 1 DocuSign Envelope ID: 81F2FD3F-5AC2-40AB-8153-810486554FA0 comply with and be bound by all of the terms and conditions of the Agreement to the same extent as if Worldpay and the Supplier were the parties thereto. 2. DURATION This Statement of Work shall commence on 1st September 2019 (\"Effective Date”) and and shall continue in full force and effect for a period of three (3) years after the Effective Date (\"Initial Term”). Following this three-year period, the Agreement shall automatically be renewed for consecutive one-year periods (\"Renewal Term”). Each Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement until the end of the Initital Term or a Renewal Term by giving to the other party a prior written notice not less than six (6) months before the expiration of the Initial Term or a Renewal Term. 3.

RIGHTS ACQUIRED. Provider grants to each Purchaser of a Product all rights and licenses necessary for the Purchaser and its Affiliates to use, transfer, pass-through and sell the Product and to otherwise exercise the rights granted under the Agreement with respect to the Product. Notwithstanding any restrictions on a Purchaser's transfer of a Product or its associated rights, and notwithstanding a Purchaser’s acquisition of less than full ownership of any Product, the Purchaser may (i) freely transfer the Product to any FIS Affiliate, together with its associated rights, and (ii) allow any FIS Affiliate to exercise any rights which the Purchaser may exercise under the Agreement with respect to the Product. Provider grants to FIS or any FIS Affiliate purchasing, licensing or otherwise acquiring rights in a Product all rights and licenses necessary to use the Product and to transfer, pass-through and sell its rights in the Product, and to otherwise exercise the rights granted under the Agreement with respect to the Product, except to the extent the Agreement expressly limits use of the Product for the benefit of a third party that is not an FIS Affiliate or expressly limits the transfer, pass-through or sale of its rights in the Product to such a third party.

FIS may use an independent auditor to assist with such verification, provided that FIS has a written confidentiality agreement in place with such independent auditor. Provider will provide to FIS and its auditors accurate electronic and written records, system tool outputs, and other requested system information sufficient to provide verification that Provider’s billing invoices are accurate and in compliance with the Agreement. FIS will notify Provider in writing if any such verification indicates that Provider is not in compliance with the Agreement, and Provider will promptly reimburse FIS for any overpayments made by FIS under the Agreement. c.

No limitation or exclusion of liability or remedies will be effective with respect to any indemnification or hold harmless obligation of Provider under the Agreement. b. REMEDIAL MEASURES. If an order, judgment or settlement is obtained or reasonably anticipated against FIS’s use of any Product on the basis of any Claim, Provider will at its sole cost and expense promptly eliminate the infringement by (i) acquiring a license or licenses on FIS’s behalf to provide the necessary rights to FIS, (ii) modifying the Product without impairing its functionality, or (iii) to the extent Provider is unable, exercising its best efforts, to successfully eliminate the infringement by either of the foregoing courses of action, notwithstanding Provider’s best efforts, providing FIS with a non-infringing substitute for the Product that provides FIS with the same functionality as the Product. c. CONDITIONS ON OBLIGATION.
