Subcontractor shall be liable for consequential, incidental, indirect, special, or punitive damages: (i) To the extent that the Subcontractor’s liability for such damages is specifically set forth in this SOW; (ii) To the extent that the Subcontractor’s liability for such damages arises out of Section 17.1.1 of the Prime Contract excluding claims arising under provisions calling for indemnification for third-party claims against the State for bodily injury to persons or damage to real or tangible personal property caused by the Subcontractor’s negligence or willful misconduct; 27457:1:FRANKFORT 2 (iii) To the extent that the Subcontractor’s liability for such damages arises out of Section 17.2 of the Prime Contract; (iv) To the extent that the Subcontractor’s liability for such damages arises out of Section 17.3 of the Prime Contract or to any other liability (including without limitation indemnification obligations) for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights; (v) For costs or attorney fees that the State becomes entitled to recover as a prevailing party in any action; or (vi) To claims covered by any specific provision herein or in the Prime Contract calling for liquidated damages. 6.2 Allocation of Damages and Indemnification Obligations.

(ii) “Background Intellectual Property” means all Intellectual Property owned by a Party as of the Effective Date of the SOW (or otherwise created independently of this SOW) and any enhancements, modifications, or improvements made solely by the owning party without the benefit of the Confidential Information of the other party. (iii) “Project Intellectual Property” means Intellectual Property that may be created, conceived, and\/or reduced to practice by CDP or FIS or their Affiliates, jointly or individually, in connection with this SOW and further limited to all Intellectual Property related to the EBT Data Warehouse and any software or inventions that enable or support features or functionalities that are related thereto and any modifications, enhancements, improvements thereof made by anyone at any time, but excluding the Background Intellectual Property of a party. 27457:1:FRANKFORT 3 (iv) “EBT Data Warehouse Processing” means the provision of technology and services pursuant to Data Warehousing Services for SNAP and Cash benefits, but excluding WIC benefits. 7.2 Intellectual Property Ownership.

Each party grants to the other and its Affiliates a limited, non-exclusive, perpetual license to make, use, modify, and reproduce any Background Intellectual Property incorporated into, or necessary to make use of any Project Intellectual Property, solely for the purpose of (1), in the case of FIS and its Affiliates, FIS’s ongoing EBT business; and, (2), in the case of CDP, CDP’s ongoing business in all fields except for the EBT Data Warehouse Processing Field. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall require FIS to provide CDP access to or copies of any source code, documentation, or other proprietary materials owned by FIS or any third party, including FIS’s Background Intellectual Property. Likewise, nothing herein shall require CDP to provide FIS access to or copies of any source code, documentation, or other proprietary materials owned by CDP or any third party, including CDP’s Background Intellectual Property. (ii) Project Intellectual Property. Project Intellectual Property will be owned solely by FIS. CDP hereby assigns all of its rights, title, and interests in and to all affected Project Intellectual Property to FIS.

The Executive Order also requires Government contractors to take affirmative action to ensure that equal opportunity is provided in all aspects of their employment. Clean Air Act Environmental Provisions The Subontractor agrees to comply with all applicable standards, orders, or regulations issued pursuant to the Clean Air Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.). Violations shall be reported to the Federal awarding agency and the Regional Office of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Clean Water Act The Clean Water Act, Section 508 stipulates: a. No Federal agency may enter into any contract with any person who has been convicted of any offense under Section 508 (c) of this Act for the procurement of goods, materials, and services if such contract is to be performed at any facility at which the violation which gave rise to such conviction occurred, and if such facility is owned, leased, or supervised by such person. The prohibition in preceding sentence shall continue until the Administrator certifies that the condition giving rise to such conviction has been corrected. The Administrator shall establish procedures to provide all Federal agencies with the notification necessary for the purposes of subsection (a) of this section. In order to implement the purposes and policy of this Act to protect and enhance the quality of the Nation’s water, the President shall, not more than 180 days after the enactment of this Act, cause to be issued an order: 1. requiring each Federal agency authorized to enter into contracts and each Federal agency which is empowered to extend Federal assistance by way of grant, loan, or contract to effectuate the purpose and policy of this Act in such contracting or assistance activities, and 2. setting forth procedures, sanctions, penalties, and such other provisions, as the President determines necessary to carry out such requirement. 63 EC88:46609:29740:1 :FRANKFORT The President may exempt any contract, loan, or grant from all or part of the provisions of this section where he determines such exemption is necessary in the paramount interest of the United States and he shall notify the Congress of such exemption. The President shall annually report to the Congress on measures taken in compliance with the purpose and intent of this section, including, but not limited to, the progress and problems associated with such compliance. (1) No certification by a contractor, and no contract clause, may be required in the case of a contract for the acquisition of commercial items in order to implement a prohibition or requirement of this section or a prohibition or requirement issued in the implementation of this section. (2) In paragraph (1), the term “commercial item” has the meaning given such term in section 4(12) of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 403(12)). Royalty-Free Rights to Use Software or Documentation Developed (a) The federal government reserves a royalty-free, non-exclusive, and irrevocable license to reproduce, publish, or otherwise use, and to authorize others to use, for federal government purposes, the copyright in any work developed under a grant, sub-grant, or contract under a grant or sub-grant or any rights of copyright to which a contractor purchases ownership. (b) Obligations (1) Notification. Whenever any invention, improvement, or discovery (whether or not patentable) is made or conceived for the first time or actually or constructively reduced to practice, Subcontractor, in the performance of this SOW, will immediately give Contractor written notice thereof, and must promptly furnish Contractor with complete information and\/or disclosure thereon. Restrictions on Lobbying The Subontractor agrees to comply with the provisions of United States Code, title 31, section 1352. The Subontractor must not use any federal funds from the State to pay any person for influencing or attempting to influence an officer or employee of a federal agency, a member of Congress, an officer or employee of Congress, or any employee of a member of Congress in connection with the awarding of any federal contract, the making of a federal grant, the making of a federal loan, or cooperative agreement.

Further, the Subontractor must include the language of this provision in all contracts and subcontracts and all contractors and subcontractors must comply accordingly. Americans with Disabilities Act This Act (28 CFR Part 35, Title II, Subtitle A) prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in all services, programs, and activities provided to the public and State and local governments, except public transportation services. Drug-Free Workplace Statement The Federal government implemented the Drug Free Workplace Act of 1988 in an attempt to address the problems of drug abuse on the job. It is a fact that employees who use drugs have less 64 EC88:46609:29740:1 :FRANKFORT productivity, a lower quality of work, and a higher absenteeism, and are more likely to misappropriate funds or services. From this perspective, the drug abuser may endanger other employees, the public at large, or themselves. Damage to property, whether owned by this entity or not, could result from drug abuse on the job. All these actions might undermine public confidence in the services this entity provides. Therefore, in order to remain a responsible source for government contracts, the following guidelines have been adopted: a. The unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession or use of a controlled substance is prohibited in the work place. b. Violators may be terminated or requested to seek counseling from an approved rehabilitation service. c. Employees must notify their employer of any conviction of a criminal drug statue no later than five days after such conviction. d. Contractors of federal agencies are required to certify that they will provide drug-free workplaces for their employees. Transactions subject to the suspension\/debarment rules (covered transactions) include grants, subgrants, cooperative agreements, and prime contracts under such awards. Subcontracts are not included. Also, the dollar threshold for covered procurement contracts is $25,000. Contracts for Federally required audit services are covered regardless of dollar amount. Debarment and Suspension As required by Executive Order 12549, Debarment and Suspension, and implemented at 34 CFR Part 85, for prospective participants in primary covered transactions, as defined at 34 CFR Part 85, Sections 85.105 and 85.110. The applicant certifies that it and its principals: 3. Are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from covered transactions by any federal department or agency; 4. Have not within a three-year period preceding this application been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (federal, state, or local) transaction or contract under a public transaction; violation of federal or state antitrust statutes or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, or receiving stolen property; 5. Are not presently indicted for or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity (federal, state, or local) with commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (1)(b) of this certification; and 6. Have not within a three-year period preceding this application had one or more public transactions (federal, state, or local) terminated for cause or default. Where the applicant is unable to certify to any of the statements in this certification, he or she shall attach an explanation to this application. 65 EC88:46609:29740:1 :FRANKFORT ","contract_name":"CW2387322","file_name":"Custom Data Processing_SOW_0818.pdf"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-05-17T06:13:55.360190Z","updated_at":"2022-05-18T05:28:21.643590Z","project":4},{"id":64,"annotations":[{"id":67,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":93,"end":110,"text":"Statement of Work","labels":["Metadata Fields -

(2) In paragraph (1), the term “commercial item” has the meaning given such term in section 4(12) of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 403(12)). Anti-Lobbying Act The Anti-Lobbying Act prohibits the recipients of Federal contracts, grants, and loans from using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative branches of the Federal government in connection with a specific contract, grant, or loan. As required by Section 1352, Title 31 of the U.S. Code and implemented at 34 CFR Part 82 for persons entering into a grant or cooperative agreement over $100,000, as defined at 34 CFR Part 82, Section 82.105 and 82.110, the applicant certifies that: a. No federal appropriated funds have been paid or will be paid, by or on behalf of the undersigned, to any person for influencing or attempting to influence an officer or employee of any agency, a member of Congress, an officer or employee of Congress, or an employee of a member of Congress 18 EC88:46609:30114:1:FRANKFORT in connection with the making of any federal grant, the entering into of any cooperative agreement, and the extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of any federal grant or cooperative agreement; b. If any funds other than federal appropriated funds have been paid or will be paid to any person for influencing or attempting to influence an officer or employee of any agency, a member of Congress, an officer or employee of Congress, or an employee of a member of Congress in connection with this federal grantor or cooperative agreement, the undersigned shall complete and submit Standard Form - LLL, “Disclosure Form to Report Lobbying,” in accordance with its instructions; c.

Americans with Disabilities Act This Act (28 CFR Part 35, Title II, Subtitle A) prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in all services, programs, and activities provided to the public and State and local governments, except public transportation services. Drug-Free Workplace Statement The Federal government implemented the Drug Free Workplace Act of 1988 in an attempt to address the problems of drug abuse on the job. It is a fact that employees who use drugs have less productivity, a lower quality of work, and a higher absenteeism, and are more likely to misappropriate funds or services. From this perspective, the drug abuser may endanger other employees, the public at large, or themselves. Damage to property, whether owned by this entity or not, could result from drug abuse on the job. All these actions might undermine public confidence in the services this entity provides. Therefore, in order to remain a responsible source for government contracts, the following guidelines have been adopted: a. The unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession or use of a controlled substance is prohibited in the work place. b. Violators may be terminated or requested to seek counseling from an approved rehabilitation service. c. Employees must notify their employer of any conviction of a criminal drug statue no later than five days after such conviction. d. Contractors of federal agencies are required to certify that they will provide drug-free workplaces for their employees. Transactions subject to the suspension\/debarment rules (covered transactions) include grants, subgrants, cooperative agreements, and prime contracts under such awards. Subcontracts are not included. Also, the dollar threshold for covered procurement contracts is $25,000. Contracts for Federally required audit services are covered regardless of dollar amount. Debarment and Suspension As required by Executive Order 12549, Debarment and Suspension, and implemented at 34 CFR Part 85, for prospective participants in primary covered transactions, as defined at 34 CFR Part 85, Sections 85.105 and 85.110. 19 EC88:46609:30114:1:FRANKFORT The applicant certifies that it and its principals: 3. Are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from covered transactions by any federal department or agency; 4. Have not within a three-year period preceding this application been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (federal, state, or local) transaction or contract under a public transaction; violation of federal or state antitrust statutes or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, or receiving stolen property; 5. Are not presently indicted for or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity (federal, state, or local) with commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (1)(b) of this certification; and 6. Have not within a three-year period preceding this application had one or more public transactions (federal, state, or local) terminated for cause or default. Where the applicant is unable to certify to any of the statements in this certification, he or she shall attach an explanation to this application.

Contractor shall permit and facilitate inspection of the Services by Owner and its representatives (including, but not limited to, Agent) and public authorities at all times.

If the Services are discretionary in nature (i.e., snow removal) and if a dispute occurs whether the Services were required and\/or appropriate, then generally applicable industry standards for comparable work in the same submarket shall be conclusive regarding whether such item was required and\/or appropriate in reference to resolving the dispute. 2. PERMITS, LICENSES. If any government permit, license or authorization shall be required or necessary for the proper and lawful performance of the Services hereunder or if the failure to secure such license, permit or authorization would, in any way, affect the Property, Agent or Owner, then Contractor, at Contractor's expense, shall duly procure and thereafter maintain such license, permit or authorization and submit the same to Agent for inspection, if requested.

NON-WAIVER PROVISIONS. The failure of Agent or Owner to insist in any one or more instances upon the strict performance of any of the covenants, terms, provisions or conditions of this Agreement or to exercise any election herein contained shall not be construed as a waiver or a relinquishment for the future of such covenant, term, provision, condition or election, but the same shall continue and remain and be in full force and effect. No waiver by Agent or Owner of any covenant, term, provision or condition of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been made unless expressed in writing and signed by Agent or Owner, as the case may be. 5.

Contractor agrees to notify Agent and Owner promptly of any events Contractor believes may result in a work stoppage, slowdown, labor dispute, strike or other labor related disruption. Contractor agrees to work in harmony with all contractors and laborers employed by Agent, Owner or others in connection with the Property. In the event of any work-stoppage or other disruption which involves the participation of Contractor’s personnel whether as a result of a dispute with Contractor or due to third party actions involving informational or organizational picketing or picketing by any labor organization against any other employer, Contractor agrees to take appropriate and prompt action to provide qualified personnel to perform the Services and to minimize any delay in performing the Services by fully cooperating in obtaining injunctions, presentation of facts, furnishing of witnesses and assisting in every reasonable way to eliminate any work-stoppage or other disruption or the effect of any work-stoppage or other disruption, or to follow such other directions as Agent or Owner shall issue.

Any attempted assignment of this Agreement or any interest therein without the prior written consent of Agent or Owner shall be null and void. 7. SUBCONTRACTING. Contractor may only sub-contract with the prior written consent of Agent or Owner, which consent may be withheld at Agent’s or Owner's sole and absolute discretion. Every subcontract must provide that the same is subject to all of the covenants, terms, provisions and conditions of this Agreement and must provide that in the event of termination or cancellation of this Agreement for any reason whatsoever, prior to the expiration of such subcontract, the subcontract will automatically terminate on the same date this Agreement is terminated or canceled.

Contractor will defend, indemnify and hold Agent and Owner harmless against any and all damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) suffered or incurred by Agent or Owner as a result of Contractor's failure to comply with this provision. Upon Contractor’s failure to comply herewith, the lien may be bonded or discharged by Agent or Owner at Contractor's sole expense.

(b) If Contractor shall default in the performance of any of its obligations under this Agreement (including without limitation violation of any anti-corruption law), then, Agent and Owner shall each have the right, without payment of any penalty, to terminate this Agreement in whole or in part immediately upon written notice to Contractor. Furthermore, this Agreement and Agent s obligation to pay any compensation to Contractor hereunder shall terminate immediately with respect to all transactions if the continuation of this Agreement would violate Applicable Anti-Corruption Laws (as such term is defined in Section 35 below). (c) If a receiver, liquidator or trustee for Contractor shall be appointed by court order; or a petition shall be filed against Contractor under any bankruptcy, reorganization or insolvency law; or Contractor shall file a petition in voluntary bankruptcy or shall request reorganization under any provision of voluntary bankruptcy, reorganization or insolvency laws; or if Contractor shall make an assignment for the benefit of creditors, then this entire Agreement shall immediately terminate upon the happening of any such event. 22.

Contractor's liability under this Section 22 shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement, but this shall not be construed to mean that Contractor's liability does not survive as to other provisions of this Agreement. 23. COMPENSATION. (a) In consideration for all of the Services to be rendered by Contractor hereunder, Agent, on behalf of Owner, agrees to pay to Contractor, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the compensation set forth on the cover page hereof or, if applicable, Exhibit “B”. (b) Under no circumstances will Contractor receive compensation in cash. (c) Agent shall have no obligation to reimburse costs and expenses (if any) incurred by Contractor in connection with any Services provided hereunder, unless such costs and expenses are supported by receipts, etc., and such costs and expenses are permissible pursuant to Applicable Anti-Corruption Laws. (d) Contractor agrees that Agent is acting only as an agent of Owner, and Contractor will look solely to Owner for any and all obligations or payments due or which may become due to Contractor under this Agreement. If at any time Agent is legally held to be an independent contractor of, rather than an agent for, Owner, Contractor agrees that it will not be paid until and unless Owner furnishes funds specifically designated for payment of the obligations due or to become due to Contractor. (e) It is hereby agreed that payment to Contractor shall be conditioned upon approval of work by all inspecting authorities and submission by Contractor to Agent of satisfactory invoice documentation required by Owner (“Invoice Package”). A complete Invoice Package shall consist of the following: (i) contractor work tickets fully describing the work performed (if applicable): (ii) Agent supplied work ticket with all information completed (if applicable); (iii) copy of Agent's Purchase Order and\/or Work Order (if applicable) or this fully executed Agreement and amendments, if any; (iv) an appropriate contractor lien waiver and lien waivers from all Contractors and subcontractors and materialmen (if applicable); (v) Material Safety Data Sheets (“MSDS”) for all regulated materials and substances left on site (if applicable); and (vi) a completed W-9 for federal tax purposes. (f) If required by Agent, Contractor will utilize Agent’s electronic invoicing process (“EIP”). Once instructed to use EIP, Contractor shall not submit its invoices in any other format, including a paper invoice. If Contractor submits an invoice in another format, said invoice will be rejected and payment will consequently be delayed. Contractor will ensure that all information contained in any invoice it submits is accurate. If any information is inaccurate, Contractor’s invoice may be rejected and payment delayed. 24. LIMITATION ON AGENT'S OBLIGATIONS. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Contractor acknowledges and agrees that Agents obligation to make payment to Contractor of any compensation hereunder shall be conditional upon Owner providing Agent with funds sufficient to pay such compensation to Contractor. In the event Owner shall fail or refuse for any reason whatsoever to provide Agent with kinds sufficient to pay the compensation due to Contractor hereunder, then Agent will not be able to make any payment of such compensation to Contractor. 25. SERVICES GUARANTEE. Contractor agrees to perform all Services in a good, timely and workerlike manner acceptable to Agent and Owner. Contractor unconditionally guarantees all materials, equipment and labor provided under this Agreement for one (1) year after date of final payment to Contractor hereunder or the date of final acceptance of the Services, whichever date is later and shall repair or replace within said period, at its sole cost and expense, any labor, materials or equipment provided or furnished under this Agreement that is damaged, defective or not satisfactory. Contractor shall make or commence to make, within three (3) days of its receipt of written notice from Agent or Owner during the guaranty period, any and all repairs or replacements, without cost to and to the satisfaction of Agent or Owner. If Agent or Owner determine that an emergency exists which requires more immediate action than Contractor is able to provide, Agent or Owner may, without sending any notice to Contractor, perform or cause to be performed such repairs or replacements that Contractor is required to make pursuant to this provision, in which event Contractor shall compensate Owner for the cost thereof not later than ten (10) business days after receipt of written demand therefor. Any repairs or replacements that Contractor is required to make pursuant to this provision shall be prosecuted to completion by Contractor even if such repairs or replacements may not be completed until after the expiration of the guaranty period. The obligations of Contractor to make repairs or replacements under this provision shall not be satisfied, unless the Owner so elects, by the payment of money to the Owner. If Agent or Owner determine in their sole and absolute discretion that any labor furnished or materials or equipment installed under this Agreement are inherently defective, thus being incapable of repair, then Contractor shall, upon notification by Agent or Owner of such a determination, provide a replacement for said labor, materials or equipment. In the event that Contractor fails to comply with C&W SERVICE CONTRACT Contract #19-001 (UPS BATTERY REPLACEMENT) DocuSign Envelope ID: 25A441BE-AFF3-4D99-90F1-EBF501C4D993 this provision, the Owner may, in addition to exercising all other legal and equitable remedies it may have, (1) deduct from any payment due or thereafter to become due to Contractor under this Agreement, the amount of damage, cost or expense caused by said failure by the Contractor, and (2) perform or cause to be performed any needed repairs and replacements, in which event Contractor shall compensate the Owner for the cost thereof. The foregoing Guarantee is in addition and supplementary to any other guarantee which may be provided by Contractor. Warranties and guarantees issued by manufacturers of materials or equipment furnished by Contractor under this Agreement shall not in any way serve to limit the obligations of Contractor under this provision. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, any such warranties or guaranties shall inure to the benefit of Agent and Owner, their successors and assigns, and Contractor shall, to the extent possible, assign such warranties and guaranties to Owner. 26. ACTS BEYOND REASONABLE CONTROL. No party shall be considered in default of any of its obligations under this Agreement to the extent that performance thereof is delayed or rendered impossible by acts of God, war, civil commotion, governmental action, fire, storm, flood, explosion, strikes, walkouts, or other industrial disturbances, or any other causes of any nature which is beyond its reasonable control. 27. PATENT\/COPYRIGHT. Contractor shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend, at its sole cost and expense, Agent and\/or Owner from any loss, damage, expense (including attorneys’ fees and costs), payment, recovery and judgment arising out of any claim or threatened claim, alleging that any Services furnished hereunder infringe upon or violate a patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary right of any third party. Owner, at its sole cost and expense, shall have the right to be represented in any such action or proceeding by independent counsel of Owner's own choice. Contractor's liability under this Section 27 shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement, but this shall not be construed to mean that Contractor's liability does not survive as to other provisions of this Agreement. 28. DIVISIBILITY. In the event any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal or unlawful, then the same shall be struck here from and all other provisions shall remain valid and in full effect. 29. ASSIGNMENT BY AGENT OR OWNER. Agent and Owner shall each have the right in their sole and absolute discretion to assign their rights and obligations under this Agreement to any other party. If the Property is at any time sold or otherwise conveyed to a new owner, or if Agent ceases to be the representative of Owner, Contractor agrees that this Agreement shall be deemed automatically assigned to the new owner or the new representative of Owner (as the facts may dictate) and Contractor agrees that it will be paid only from funds furnished by Owner or the new owner for obligations then due or which thereafter become due to Contractor under the Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Owner may elect by giving prior written notice to Contractor, to terminate this Agreement effective as of the date that such sale is completed or effective as of the date that Agent ceases to be the representative of Owner, in which event this Agreement shall, except as otherwise provided herein, be of no further force or effect.

Provider’s indemnification obligations under this Section will include any and all liabilities, losses, costs, damages, and expenses (including court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees) associated with each Claim. No limitation or exclusion of liability or remedies will be effective with respect to any indemnification or hold harmless obligation of Provider under the Agreement. b. REMEDIAL MEASURES. If an order, judgment or settlement is obtained or reasonably anticipated against FIS’s use of any Product on the basis of any Claim, Provider will at its sole cost and expense promptly eliminate the infringement by (i) acquiring a license or licenses on FIS’s behalf to provide the necessary rights to FIS, (ii) modifying the Product without impairing its functionality, or (iii) to the extent Provider is unable, after exercising commercially reasonable efforts, to successfully eliminate the infringement by either of the foregoing courses of action, providing FIS with a non-infringing substitute for the Product that provides FIS with the same functionality as the Product.

Below is a summary' of the BCP that exists at Vendor. Vendor business continuity plan ( 'BCP’') addresses all threats identified through risk planning: higher\/lower coverage level based on their threat perception and willingness to bear the cost for higher levels of continuity. In terms of the plan, data backup will be stored at a designated recovery site at the agreed frequency. The BCP for Vendor is defined and monitored by a disaster recovery ( ‘DR \") team. Events that can cause interruptions to business processes such as: > Natural disasters (earthquake, fire, flood, storms) > War and terrorist acts (weapons of mass destruction) > Political, labor strikes and other unrest > Computer shut down due to hackers\/virus\/administrator or user error > Power disruptions and power failure > Network\/telecommunications outage > Accidents > Sabotage The DR committee will assess the damage, discuss with all concerned members and draw a recovery plan. The recovery plan will contain the details on the people and physical infrastructure to be recovered. Vendor has in place a well defined policy document for back-up and restoration of data and a procedural document that outlines the process to be followed for back-up and restoration. We outline some of the standard back-up procedures that are followed in all FNF projects. Any back  up requirements specific to a particular project will be discussed, documented and executed as part of the Project Management Plan. Back-up: Backup strategy for all project data stored in the common file servers is to take periodic back  ups as outlined below: 1. Daily Backup Cumulative incremental backup will be done for all file server drives from Monday through Thursday. Fifteen (15) sets (MTWT) of media will be retained. Rotation of media is done once every 15 weeks. 2. Weekly Backup Full backup of all file server drives will be done once every week. Backup media will be retained for ninety (90) calendar days. 3. Month End Backup Three sets of month end full backup will be taken. One set will be retained in the primary location where the project is executed and two sets will be dispatched to disaster recovery sites for business continuity purposes. FNF125-ING-Neiherlands - v5.doc Page 12 of 16 MASTER SERVICES PROVIDER AGREEMENT - EXHIBIT A 4. Project Archive Archival backup of project data will be done based on periodicity discussed and decided. Two copies will be taken; one to be stored at offsite location of the region and other at the disaster recovery site. Restore Senices: Data restoration request from stakeholders due to accidental loss or corruption are to be completed before the end of next business day. However lime lines for emergency restoration requests can be mutually arrived and serviced. Manger of the requester is to approve all data restoration requests. Test Restore Full test restoration of file server is performed once in a quarter to check the integrity of the process as part of disaster recovery operations. Full restore logs arc to be retained for audit purposes. Full test restoration periodicity will also depend on individual project duration.

Swedesford Road, Wayne, PA, 19355 (“Customer”). Customer and Vendor are individually referred to herein as a “Party” and collectively as “Parties”. For and in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants contained hereinafter, the sufficiency and adequacy of which is hereby acknowledged by both parties, intending to be legally bound, the Vendor and Customer agree as follows: 1. BACKGROUND 1.1. Definitions. Capitalized terms used in the Agreement have the meanings set forth in Schedule 1 unless otherwise defined. 1.2. Customer offers a utility solution to clients (\"PTD Clients\") through which Customer will provide post-trade processing services for futures and cleared derivatives transactions, including technology and related services in support thereof (the “PTD Utility Solution”). 1.3. Customer and Barclays Bank plc entered into a certain agreement, as of March 5, 2015, pursuant to which Customer agreed to acquire certain assets and hire certain employees of Barclays Bank plc and its Affiliates (\"Barclays\") relating to the post-trade processing operations of Barclays (including the technology and related services that support such operations), and Barclays agreed to receive from Customer post-trade processing services for futures and cleared derivatives transactions through the PTD Utility Solution, all subject to the completion of certain closing conditions set forth in such agreement (the completion of such conditions is referred to as, the \"Closing\"). The Closing will be effective as of May 31, 2015. 1.4. One of the conditions to Closing is that Customer and Barclays enter into a definitive agreement for the provision of services through the PTD Utility Solution (the \"Barclays Utility Agreement\"), the terms of which have been substantially agreed between Customer and Barclays. 1.5. Prior to and as of the Master Effective Date, Vendor was and continues to be a provider of certain post-trade processing services to Barclays with respect to the systems that host and support the post¬ trade processing operations of Barclays. 1.6. After the Closing, (i) responsibility for the technology operations that support the post-trade processing operations of Barclays will transfer to Customer, and (ii) Vendor, as a subcontractor to Customer, will continue to provide certain post-trade processing services for the benefit of Barclays, as described in more detail in this Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. 1.7. The Parties agreed to certain terms and conditions relating to the ongoing provision of the Services by Vendor in a certain letter agreement between the Parties dated as of March 6, 2015 (the \"Letter Agreement\"), including that Customer and Vendor would promptly proceed with the negotiation of a mutually acceptable definitive master services agreement under which Vendor would provide services to Customer Entities and shall, as a subcontractor to Customer, provide services to Barclays in connection with the PTD Utility Solution. This Agreement is the result of such negotiations and is such definitive Page 1 of 27 SunGard Confidential Execution Version master services agreement. The Parties agree that Vendor may provide services to Customer for the benefit of itself and other PTD Clients in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, which may be pursuant to separate Statements of Work as appropriate. 1.8. Schedules. This Agreement consists of: (a) the terms contained herein; (b) and the Schedules attached hereto and made part hereof, which include Schedule 1 (Definitions), Schedule 2 (Flow-Down Provisions), Schedule 3 (Business Continuity Management), and Schedule 4 (Termination Assistance). Vendor shall provide the Services pursuant to and in accordance with the Schedules, including, but not limited to, Business Continuity Management as further set forth in Schedule 3; and (c) the Statements of Work entered into under this Agreement. 2. SCOPE OF SERVICES 2.1. Statement of Work. Customer retains Vendor for, and Vendor accepts and agrees to provide Customer with, services in post-trade processing (collectively, the “Services”). The scope and description of the Services, including supervision and management of the Services to be provided by Vendor and specific Deliverables, will be mutually agreed and set forth in one or more statements of work (each, a “Statement of Work” or “SOW”). Each Statement of Work that may be executed by the Parties under this Agreement will be substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A, referencing this Agreement. All SOWs will be part of this Agreement. The Services shall be provided at the rates set forth in Exhibit B or as otherwise agreed to by the Parties; provided that, in either case, additional terms and conditions governing such rates, as agreed in a SOW, shall apply. \"Deliverables\" means the deliverables and output that Vendor creates or develops and provides to Customer or a PTD Client or inputs into the Customer Systems and\/or the Utility Customer Software in connection with the Services. 2.2. Use of Affiliates. Any Statement of Work, when executed by both Parties shall be deemed to incorporate all applicable provisions of this Agreement. If Customer or any Customer Entities desire Vendor to provide Services outside of the United States or Vendor’s Global Delivery Centers located in India, Vendor may, or Vendor may cause an applicable local Affiliate of Vendor to, enter into the applicable Statement of Work incorporating the provisions of this Agreement with the Customer or applicable local Affiliate of Customer. A Statement of Work for Services to a Customer Affiliate located outside the United States may have additional terms, if required, to meet the local Law requirements. In such cases, for purposes of each such Statement of Work, any reference to Vendor as used in this Agreement shall be deemed to mean the applicable Vendor Affiliate executing the Statement of Work and reference to Customer shall be deemed to mean the applicable Customer Affiliate executing the applicable Statement of Work or Customer. Each of Vendor and Customer retain responsibility for the Services and performances of their respective Affiliates under such Statement of Work. Further, in performing the Services hereunder Vendor may utilize the personnel, resources and facilities of Vendor and such Affiliates; provided that in all such cases Vendor remains fully responsible and liable for the performance of Services and, as between Customer and Vendor, with respect to each individual assigned by Vendor to perform the Services, Vendor shall retain the same responsibilities and liabilities as Vendor has with respect to Vendor’s own employees. 2.3. Change in Scope of Services in a Statement of Work. Either Party may request a change in the scope of Services or Deliverables but no such change shall be effective and binding unless such changes are documented in a change control document and signed by both parties. If Customer desires to propose a Page 2 of 27 SunGard Confidential Execution Version change in a Statement of Work, Customer shall deliver to Vendor a change request in writing, describing the changes proposed. Promptly following Vendor’s receipt of Customer’s change request, Vendor shall submit a written change order proposal to Customer. If Vendor desires to propose any change Vendor shall submit to the Customer a written description of the change in the form of a proposed change order for Customer’s review and approval. Any change order document prepared by the parties shall include, among other items, an estimate of additional charges to Customer, if applicable, for the modified Services, any additional software or other material required to implement the change and any expected impact on the schedule or service levels under the Statement of Work. On Customer’s written approval of the change order document submitted by Vendor the parties shall sign the change order whereupon the Statement of Work shall be deemed to have been amended by the change order. No change to any Statement of Work shall be binding on the parties unless the change order has been signed by authorized representatives of each party. Unless a change is technically not feasible, prohibited by Law or would put Vendor in breach of (or which might, in Vendor's reasonable opinion, put Vendor in breach of) its obligations to its other customers, Vendor shall not refuse to make a change (provided always that if the change is necessary for Customer or a PTD Client to comply with applicable Laws the Parties shall use all reasonable endeavours to agree a resolution to such conflicting requirements). If a change is a new service or is a change for which additional material charges would apply, Vendor will not be required to commence implementing the change until the Parties have agreed to the charges to implement such change (provided that if the Parties are not in agreement and the charges are FTE-based, Customer may agree to pay using the rate card subject to resolution of the issue). Customer shall have final approval rights over change orders. 2.4. Project Lead; Reports. With respect to each SOW, each party shall appoint a qualified staff member or other representative to act as project lead (each, a “Project Lead”) for the Services to be performed under each Statement of Work (provided that one Project Lead may act as Project Lead for the Services to be provided under more than one, or all, Statements of Work). Each Project Lead shall act as the single point of contact for the party appointing such Project Lead in connection with the performance of such Services. Vendor agrees to submit written reports on the progress of the Services performed under each Statement of Work which at a minimum will include (a) monthly and quarterly governance reports in the aggregate and by PTD Client and (b) daily and monthly performance reports by PTD Client. Each Statement of Work will include details of any applicable additional reporting requirements. Vendor will provide other reports as are reasonably requested by SunGard if Vendor can produce such reports using the Vendor Personnel assigned to provide the Services and without incurring material additional cost. The format and detail of the reports shall be agreed to by the Parties. 2.5. Vendor Personnel. The persons assigned by Vendor to perform the Services (the “Vendor Personnel”) shall have appropriate technical and professional skills and experience to enable them to perform their duties in a professional and workmanlike manner, consistent with generally accepted industry standards for the performance of such Services. Vendor represents and warrants that (a) it has conducted appropriate background checks and other employment screening consistent with the requirements set forth in Vendor's existing agreement with Barclays prior to the Effective Date and (b) for all other Vendor Personnel, it has (or as the case may be, will have) conducted appropriate background checks and other employment screening consistent with those requirements set forth in Exhibit 4 (Employee Screening) of Schedule 2 within the 12 months prior to being assigned to the provision of the Services under this Agreement. Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain continuity of its personnel while providing the Services. In the event that Vendor replaces any person performing Services under a Statement of Work with another person, Customer shall not be responsible for any costs associated with any training, orientation or other steps to bring such replacement person to the same level as the replaced person that was required solely as a result of such replacement and Vendor shall be responsible for all such costs. While at Customer’s facilities, all persons assigned by Vendor to perform the Services shall observe and follow Customer’s reasonable work rules, security policies and standards as the same are provided to Vendor. Vendor shall promptly remove from performance of the Services any Vendor personnel engaging in any Page 3 of 27 SunGard Confidential Execution Version behavior unacceptable to Customer at Customer’s sole discretion, and Vendor shall promptly provide a replacement acceptable to Customer with suitable experience, ability and qualifications. 2.6. Key Personnel. Vendor shall identify any agreed key personnel in a Statement of Work (“Key Personnel”). Before assigning an individual to a Key Personnel position, whether as an initial assignment or as a replacement, Vendor shall: (i) notify Customer of the proposed assignment; (ii) specify how long that individual has been with Vendor; (iii) at Customer’s request, introduce the individual to appropriate representatives of Customer (if appropriate via video conference); and (iv) provide Customer with a resume or any other information regarding the individual that may be reasonably requested by Customer as permitted by Law. If Customer objects to the proposed assignment, Vendor shall discuss such objections with Customer and attempt to resolve them on a mutually agreeable basis. If Customer continues to object to the proposed assignment, Vendor shall not assign that individual to that position and shall propose another individual to fill the applicable Key Personnel position within a reasonable period following Customer initial rejection which may need to include a period of time while Vendor conducts a search for an appropriate candidate (and the costs of which may need to be borne by Customer). Vendor agrees not to remove Key Personnel except with prior approval of Customer (such approval not be unreasonably withheld by the Customer), save that no Key Personnel shall be required to stay in the relevant role for more than 12 months and save that nothing shall prevent Vendor replacing any Key Personnel as a consequence of the relevant person being on long-term sick leave or leaving the employment of Vendor. 2.7. Non-solicitation. Vendor and Customer each agree that during the relevant SOW Term Vendor Personnel or Customer employees are associated with a Statement of Work hereunder and for a period of six months after such person ceases to be so associated, neither Vendor nor Customer shall, directly or indirectly, solicit for hire or knowingly hire or retain the personnel of the other party as an employee or independent contractor or through a third party vendor or service provider of the Customer, except with prior written consent of the other party. The foregoing restriction shall not apply to: (a) the employment of any person who responds to any general recruitment advertisement by a party in the normal course of business, without specifically targeting or approaching the personnel of the other party; or (b) the employment of any person after such person is terminated by Vendor or Customer, as applicable. 2.8. Service Locations. The Services will be performed by Vendor at facilities owned or operated by Vendor or facilities of the Customer. The facilities from where the Services will be provided shall be identified and set forth in the applicable Statement of Work. Unless a Statement of Work provides otherwise, Vendor will be responsible to provide office space, general computing environment with standard tools and development environment at Vendor’s facilities, as reasonably necessary for the performance of Services at such facilities. As set forth in a Statement of Work, Customer is responsible to provide office space, office facilities (such as work stations, telephone, internet, fax and printers) computing equipment, desktop software, tools and development environment reasonably required for Vendor personnel to perform the Services on site as agreed by Customer and Vendor. Customer agrees to grant access to relevant locations and systems, data media, documentation, data, information and computer programs reasonably necessary for the performance Services during its normal business hours. 2.9. Monitoring. Subject to applicable Law, Customer reserves the right to: (a) monitor Vendor’s access to and use of the Customer Systems and the Utility Customer Software and (b) restrict Vendor’s access to the Customer Systems and the Utility Customer Software in the event Customer, in its sole reasonable discretion, determines that Vendor’s use of or access to the Customer Systems or Utility Customer Software should be restricted (1) because such use or access (i) poses a reasonably likely threat to internal or external security measures of the Customer Entities or any PTD Client, (ii) may be in violation of applicable Law, or (iii) may be in violation of the policies with which Vendor has agreed to comply pursuant to this Agreement, or (2) for any other legitimate business reason of Customer or a PTD Client. In Page 4 of 27 SunGard Confidential Execution Version the event Customer restricts access to the Customer Systems or the Utility Customer Software, Vendor shall be excused from performance of the Services to the extent impacted by the restriction for as long as such restriction is in effect and provided that Vendor notified Customer of such impact in advance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Vendor will not be excused for any breach of its obligations under this Agreement that resulted in the restriction. 2.10. Customer Oversight. Vendor will (in the case of premises used exclusively to provide Services to Barclays, subject to Barclays' consent) permit Customer personnel to be present at those parts of Vendor Sites used to provide Services under this Agreement and to have reasonable access to Vendor Systems (including tools), documentation and processes, Vendor Personnel and output and work product of Vendor (in each case where and to the extent used to provide the Services) for the purposes of overseeing and monitoring the Services and Vendor performance. Vendor will make work space available at Vendor Sites for such purposes. Vendor and Customer will agree from time to time the number of Customer personnel that can access and use space at Vendor Sites. Where such access is for greater than a (continuous) month, Vendor shall be entitled to charge Customer for the use of space and facilities at its premises in such circumstances. For the avoidance of doubt, this shall not entitle Customer personnel to have access to any Vendor Systems used to provide Services to Vendor's other customers or access to the data or confidential information of Vendor's other customers. 2.11. Knowledge Sharing and Cooperation. Upon request from Customer or Vendor from time to time, Vendor will shall meet with representatives of Customer (and vice versa) in order to (a) explain how the processes and Systems work and should be operated, (b) explain how the Services are provided and (c) provide such information and documentation as Customer or Vendor may reasonably require to understand the operation of the processes and systems. Each party will reasonably cooperate with the other party (upon that other party's request), including by providing documentation, data and other information relating to the Services. Customer may provide such documentation, data or other information directly to regulators and PTD Clients, provided that in the case of disclosure to PTD Clients Customer does so under appropriate obligations of confidence. 3. DELIVERABLES. The provisions of this Section 3 shall apply to Deliverables that Vendor has agreed to develop and deliver to Customer pursuant to a Statement of Work, unless otherwise specified by the Parties on the applicable Statement of Work. 3.1. Provision of Deliverables. All Deliverables identified in each SOW will be provided to Customer as specified in the applicable Statement of Work, or as may be otherwise mutually agreed to by the parties in writing. With respect to the development of any software, a Statement of Work may involve the creation of one or more software Deliverables to be prepared by Vendor. Parties may set forth in such Statement of Work or attachments thereto the procedure for review and testing by Customer of each Deliverable, including the period within which Customer is required to complete the review and testing of such Deliverable (“Review and Acceptance Period”). 3.2. Review and Acceptance of Deliverables. Upon delivery of a completed Deliverable by Vendor (“Review Commencement Date”), Customer shall review and, if appropriate, test such Deliverable to determine whether it conforms to its corresponding specifications under the applicable Statement of Work and to otherwise determine whether the Deliverable meets mutually agreed acceptance criteria that are set out in the applicable Statement of Work (“Acceptance Criteria”). If the Deliverable fails to meet the Acceptance Criteria, Customer shall prior to the expiry of the Review and Acceptance Period, notify Vendor of such failure with reasonable details of the defects and non-conformities (“Non-Conformities”). 3.3.

EXHIBIT 4 EMPLOYEE SCREENING Employee Screening Exhibit This Exhibit describes the screening requirements applicable to Vendor employees providing the Services, subject to local Laws and customary practices. How to Perform Checks Vendor may conduct checks themselves or engage a third party screening company to do so. Customer’s supplier managers do not need to see the evidence behind each check as and when it is completed. However, Customer’s internal specialists may be used to test compliance with the screening requirements. During any audit permitted under the Agreement, Customer may request that Vendor provide an overview of its screening process, which shall include evidence of the pass\/fail confirmations from Vendor’s screening vendor. Role Evaluation For the purposes of this Exhibit, 'Medium Risk’ and 'High Risk’ roles are those determined as such by Customer to establish the appropriate level of screening. By way of example only, the following factors may be considered when assessing whether roles are Medium or High Risk: access to Customer’s premises, infrastructure and systems and whether such access is unrestricted or otherwise without supervision of any Customer employee, access to personal or sensitive commercial information, possession or control of Customer’s assets (including hardware), the seniority of the role and whether any approval for the role is required from regulatory bodies. Vendor will perform sanctions screening as per check 7 below where not otherwise legally prohibited. Where an individual who is already assigned to Customer is appointed from a Low Risk to a Medium Risk role, or from a Medium to a High Risk role, Vendor will perform any additional \"top-up\" screening required under that risk standard within the timeframes specified. Document Retention Documentation must be seen when performing checks and a copy signed, dated and retained by Vendor or their screening provider to evidence the completion of the checks. Vendor will retain such document during the Term and for two years after the expiration or termination of the Agreement. 1. Identity Verification Timing: Before assignment starts. Scope: All roles. Purpose: To prove that the person is who they say they are. Evidence: Original, valid government issued document showing a photograph of the applicant and their name e.g. passport, ID card or driver’s license. 2. Legal Right to Work in the Assignment Country Timing: Before assignment starts. Scope: All roles. Purpose: To prove compliance with local legal requirements. Evidence: Specific to each country however expected evidence would be an original government issued document. It is Vendor’s responsibility to determine that the person seeking employment has the legal right to work in the country in which employment is sought. 3. Address Verification Timing: Before assignment starts. Scope: Medium and High Risk roles. Purpose: To prove that the person resides at a fixed abode. Evidence: Current driving license, a utility bill, a bank or credit card statement, a residential lease agreement, an insurance agreement, a voters polling card or government benefits or tax documentation which is dated no more than three months ago unless the document is annual. 4. Career Verification (including any full-time education in the period) Timing: Within eight weeks of the start of assignment. Scope: Medium and High Risk roles (excluding roles related to facilities and building domestic maintenance). Purpose: To prove that employment history for the relevant period (as specified below) was without incident or gaps. Evidence: References from previous employer(s) covering last the three years for Medium Risk roles or five years for High Risk roles, unless a role is regulated in the United States (to the extent Vendor is made aware of such), in which case cover a 10 year period. If references are not possible, verify alternative documentation to support employment such as payslips (first and last of employment ideally), bank statements or government issued tax documentation confirming employment. For career gaps identified between employment and \/ or full time education that are less than three months, obtain reason from the candidate. For gaps greater than three months, obtain, using Vendor’s standard form, Declaration of Fact only, unless a regulated role where supporting evidence should be requested. For all gaps greater than six months, obtain Declaration of Fact and also request supporting evidence. 5. Company Verification Timing: Within eight weeks of the start of assignment. Scope: Medium and High Risk roles (excluding roles related to facilities and building domestic maintenance). Purpose: To prove via independent means that prior employers declared by the candidate as part of their career history, are bona fide contacts and therefore references obtained are reliable. Evidence: Company registrations e.g. Companies House or local equivalents, entries in telephone or postal directories, payslips showing the name of the company or tax certificates. For self-employment, registered accountants’ letters are permitted. 6. Academic & Professional Qualification Verification Timing: Within eight weeks of the start of assignment. Scope: Medium and High Risk roles (excluding roles related to facilities and building domestic maintenance). Purpose: To validate that individuals possess the academic and professional qualifications where required by Vendor for the role. Evidence: Original certificates or references from the awarding body. 7. Sanctions Timing: Before assignment starts. Scope: All applicable roles as agreed with Customer (which at a minimum would include any roles where there is access to Customer Data or Customer Confidential Information, access to any data of PTD Clients or access to any systems of Customer or any PTD Client). Purpose: To prove compliance with legal requirements (in some jurisdictions) and support Customer status as a regulated financial services provider. Evidence: No matches against approved sanctions database checks. 8. Credit \/ bankruptcy check (including international checks if appropriate) Timing: Before assignment starts (within eight weeks of assignment date for international checks if the individual has lived at a fixed abode overseas for more than three months in the prior three years (five years for regulated positions)). Scope: Medium and High Risk roles. Purpose: To support that the individual is not susceptible to corruption. Evidence: To determine whether an individual passes this check, Vendor will consider recent non¬ discharged bankruptcies or where the bankruptcy discharge is automatic, multiple bankruptcies whether discharged or not, material penalties for tax evasion and material outstanding debts which have been through the legal courts. The parties acknowledge that as of the Effective Date credit checks cannot be reliably carried out in India. 9. Criminal Record check (including international checks if appropriate) Timing: Within eight weeks of the start of assignment, including international checks which should be completed if the individual has lived at a fixed abode overseas (i.e., outside of country where the individual was originally employed) for more than three months in the prior three years (five years for regulated positions). Scope: Medium and High Risk roles. Purpose: To support that the individual is of good character. Evidence: Declaration from the individual about any convictions matched against the results of a search against approved criminal record databases \/ sources. To determine whether an individual passes this check, Vendor will consider any convictions or charges pending in respect of the following crimes: offences of a sexual nature, violence against person(s), fraud, theft, blackmail, possession of weapons, distribution of illegal drugs, possession of serious illegal drugs and a driving ban if driving is fundamental to the role. Vendor will consider failure of a criminal check as a factor in the screening process, but the failure of such check will not result in an immediate screening failure. 10. Directorship check Timing: Within eight weeks of the start of assignment. Scope: High Risk roles only. Purpose: To identify any potential conflicts of interest and\/or previous disqualifications from being a Director. Evidence: Declaration from the individual compared to results of check against independent company registers\/databases. 11. Media check Timing: Within eight weeks of the start of assignment. Scope: High Risk roles Purpose: To identify any potential conflicts of interest and\/or risk to Customer reputation. Evidence: Results from a check against a media search database or if not available, an internet search. 12. Reserved 13. Additional requirements specific for suppliers providing services to or in the United States 13.1 On Customer’s request (at Customer’s own expense), for Vendor employees working on-site at a Customer location, Vendor will promptly require any Vendor employees to provide Customer with fingerprint specimens and\/or a completed background and security questionnaire on a form provided by Customer, which Customer may use to conduct its own criminal record or other checks. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, on Customer’s request, Vendor shall remove a person from assignment from Customer if: a) the person does not provide fingerprint specimens or complete the background and security information requested; or b) in Vendor's sole judgment, the background verification results are unsatisfactory (including as a result of any inaccurate or unverified information). Customer has no obligation to disclose to Vendor or Vendor Personnel, any reasons for Customer’s decision, or share any information obtained through any background investigation, except where required by law. 14. Changes To Personal Circumstances And Failure To Disclose Information Where the Vendor Relationship Manager becomes aware: 14.1 Of any changes in any of the circumstances of any person to be assigned to Customer e.g. new criminal convictions, judgments or court orders for criminal offences, then it shall investigate and risk assess such circumstances using the same checks as set out above and take appropriate action; or 14.2 That a person has failed to disclose material information under or pursuant to the screening process, then Vendor shall remove such person from assignment to Customer. Where a former employee of Vendor re-joins them having previously left their employment, the following will apply: 14.3 Where the individual is rehired after a gap of more than 3 months, they must undergo the standard screening process, although it may be possible to re-use evidence previously obtained in agreement with Customer; and 14.4 If the individual is rehired after a gap of less than 3 months, Vendor can take a risk based approach to decide if additional screening is required which should be documented, however evidence of Legal Right to Work should be obtained in all cases. 15. Incomplete Checks or Adverse Results If Vendor cannot perform checks because of local legal reasons they are automatically exempt from doing so and need only notify Customer of this. If: 15.1 Vendor cannot perform checks for operational reasons (e.g. credit reference agencies do not exist in a jurisdiction); 15.2 Vendor cannot perform sanctions checks for either operational or legal reasons; or 15.3 Vendor personnel do not pass checks, the following apply: If there are no legal or operational barriers to Vendor’s ability to perform the checks but the required evidence cannot be gathered for a particular individual, Vendor must obtain prior agreement from Customer if they still wish to assign that individual to Customer-related work. If an individual fails to meet Vendor's standards but Vendor still wishes to assign them to Customer- related work, Vendor must obtain prior written agreement from Customer unless a different approach is agreed in contract terms.

In addition, Provider will require the individual to report any criminal convictions. Provider will not assign anyone to perform Services for FIS who has tested positive for drugs or whose background check findings do not meet the standards established by Provider in accordance with all applicable Laws, including if there is a conviction or referral to a pretrial diversion program for a crime that is related to his or her duties. Provider acknowledges that under the banking Laws, an individual may not participate, directly or indirectly, in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of any insured depository institution without regulatory consent if he or she has a conviction, or has agreed to enter into a pretrial diversion or similar program in connection with a prosecution, of a crime involving dishonesty, breach of trust or money laundering, including any crime concerning the illegal manufacture, sale, distribution of or trafficking in controlled substances, unless the crime meets certain criteria for treating the crime as de minimis. The background check must be completed before assignment of an individual and periodically thereafter. d.

PART 3. SAFEGUARDING OF INFORMATION Procurement Contract Supplement Ver. 02-03-2015 Page 2 a. PROTECTION OF FIS CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. Provider must protect all FIS Confidential Information with at least the same degree of care it uses to protect its own confidential information, but in no event will Provider use less than a reasonable standard of care to protect any FIS Confidential Information. (1) Provider will (i) restrict the use and disclosure of FIS Confidential Information to Provider Personnel and do so solely on a “need to know” basis in connection with Provider’s obligations to perform Services, (ii) ensure Provider Personnel who receive or have access to FIS Confidential Information are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive and as protective of the FIS Confidential Information as the provisions of this PART 3, (iii) establish procedural, physical and electronic safeguards, designed to prevent the compromise or unauthorized disclosure of FIS Confidential Information and to achieve the objectives of the Guidelines (if applicable), (iv) not use or disclose any FIS Confidential Information except in accordance with the Agreement, (v) promptly investigate any security breach to determine whether such incident has resulted or is likely to result in misuse or unauthorized possession or disclosure of FIS Confidential Information; and (vi) promptly notify FIS of any Breach discovered by Provider. (2) In providing any notice of a Breach, Provider will use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) provide notice to one or more FIS managers generally responsible for security matters relating to the FIS Confidential Information affected by the Breach, within twenty-four (24) hours of discovering the Breach, and (ii) keep FIS informed as to the actual and anticipated effects of the Breach and the corrective actions taken or to be taken in response to the Breach. In addition, if the Breach results or is likely to result in misuse of NPI, PHI or payment card data, Provider will (A) notify FIS as soon as possible and reasonably cooperate with FIS in its efforts to notify affected Clients and their customers and to mitigate the actual or potential harm resulting from the Breach and (B) reimburse FIS for its reasonable costs in notifying Clients or their customers of the Breach and making available to them any credit monitoring services and for any other costs FIS reasonably incurs with respect to the Breach. (3) FIS Confidential Information will remain the property of FIS, its Affiliate or other party from or through whom it was provided. (4) Except for NPI, PHI, other information protected by the Privacy Regulations, or any payment card data, (a) the parties’ respective confidentiality obligations under the Agreement do not apply to any information that: (i) was previously known by the party; (ii) is a matter of public knowledge; (iii) was or is independently developed by the party; (iv) is released for disclosure with written consent of the party; or (v) is received from a third party to whom it was disclosed without restriction. (b) each party may disclose information notwithstanding its confidentiality obligations under the Agreement to the extent required (i) by Law, (ii) in connection with the tax treatment or tax structure of the Agreement; or (iii) in response to a valid order of a U.S. court or other governmental body, provided that the party provides the other party with written notice and the other party is afforded a reasonable opportunity to obtain a protective order with respect to the disclosure. (5) At the end of the Term, or upon the prior termination of the Agreement, Provider will destroy all FIS Confidential Information in a manner designed to preserve its confidentiality, or, at FIS’s written request and expense, return it to FIS. (6) FIS will have and retain all right, title and interest in all FIS Confidential Information, whether possessed by FIS prior to, or acquired or refined by FIS (either independently or in concert with Provider) during the Term of the Agreement. (7) Provider will not, without the prior written consent of FIS, (i) provide the Services or access, store or process any FIS Confidential Information outside the United States, or (ii) export any FIS Confidential Information to anywhere outside the United States. The provisions of the Agreement (as modified by this Supplement) apply without regard to where the Services are provided or FIS Confidential Information is accessed, stored or processed. b. SPECIFIC PRECAUTIONS. Provider represents and warrants that it has and will maintain in place commercially reasonable precautions to safeguard the confidentiality, security and integrity of FIS Confidential Information in a manner designed to meet the requirements of this PART 3. These precautions will include but will not be limited to (i) contractual restrictions on access to the information by Contractors and Provider’s other vendors, (ii) intrusion detection systems on all information systems of FIS maintained or controlled by Provider, and (iii) notification procedures for notifying FIS promptly in the event a security breach is detected or suspected, as well as other response programs when there is a suspected or detected Breach involving NPI, PHI or payment card data. These precautions will also include, as appropriate, (A) access controls to FIS information systems, including controls to identify and permit access only to authorized individuals and controls to prevent access to FIS Confidential Information through improper means, (B) Provider Personnel controls and training, (C) physical access restrictions at locations where FIS Confidential Information is located, (D) encryption of electronic FIS Confidential Information when appropriate or legally required, and (E) a disaster recovery plan as appropriate to protect against loss or Procurement Contract Supplement Page 3 Ver. 02-03-2015 damage to FIS Confidential Information due to potential hazards such as fire or water damage or technological failures. Provider will (1) monitor the foregoing measures with periodic audits or testing and (2) provide copies of the same sufficient to assure FIS or its regulatory authorities that Provider is implementing these precautions, and (3) notify FIS immediately in the event there is any suspected or actual unauthorized access, use, disclosure or alteration to FIS Confidential Information. Provider will indemnify FIS from, defend FIS against, and pay any final judgments awarded against FIS, resulting from any claim brought by a third party, including but not limited to a customer of FIS, against FIS based on any breach of such privacy Laws, rules or regulations by Provider, including Provider Personnel. c.

(3) “Law” means applicable laws collectively, including statutes, codes, rules, regulations, ordinances and orders of governmental authorities. (4) The “Privacy Regulations” are the standards, guidelines and other regulations established by various federal or state regulatory agencies to protect the privacy and security of customer or patient information held by financial institutions, medical service providers and other entities. PART 4. PURCHASE AND USE OF PRODUCTS a. PURCHASING BY FIS AFFILIATES. Any FIS Affiliate may purchase, license or otherwise acquire rights in Products under the Agreement to the same extent as FIS has the right to do so, so long as it continues to be an FIS Affiliate.

The managed services program encompasses SOW creation, approval, processing, resource and expense invoicing and SOW closure. Participation in this program requires execution of an Agency Services Agreement with FIS’s third-party supplier of the managed services program. This Agency Services Agreement shall reference the applicable Master Services Agreement between the Provider and FIS, describe the relationship between the parties, confirm their various responsibilities, and define the applicable MSP fee, which shall be deducted from each invoice as described in the Agency Services Agreement. This provision is specifically for SOW services and does not apply to licensing, subscription or recurring managed service agreements or to agreements for legal or tax services. c. BILLING RECORDS.

FIS may use an independent auditor to assist with such verification, provided that FIS has a written confidentiality agreement in place with such independent auditor. Provider will provide to FIS and its auditors accurate electronic and written records, system tool outputs, and other requested system information sufficient to provide verification that Provider’s billing invoices are accurate and in compliance with the Agreement.

CONDITIONS ON OBLIGATION.

Provider will bear the expense of any such compliance remedy. Any audit hereunder will be subject to the following limitations: (i) use of any third party auditor that is a competitor of Provider will be subject to Provider’s prior written approval, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed; and (ii) FIS or the auditor conducting any such audit will at all times comply with any and all reasonable security and confidentiality guidelines and other policies of Provider with respect to the audit. e.

MAINTENANCE POLICY: The terms and conditions of Dundas' Product Support are set forth at: http:\/\/www.dundas.com\/support\/support-center\/support-terms (the \"Support Terms\"), which are incorporated into this Agreement by reference. Dundas will provide Licensee with Product Support for a period of one (1) year from the date of purchase of the applicable License, free of additional charge (as further outlined in the Support Terms). Thereafter, Dundas’ obligation to provide Product Support and Licensee’s obligation to pay the Product Support fee will renew automatically for successive renewal terms of one (1) year each, unless either party gives written notice to the other party of its desire not to renew at least sixty (60) days prior to the start of the then applicable Product Support renewal period. Licensee shall pay Dundas’ then current fees for Product Support at least thirty (30) days in advance of the commencement of the then applicable Product Support renewal period.

Licensee may terminate this Agreement for convenience at any time by uninstalling, destroying or returning to Dundas all copies of the Software and Documentation; provided that no such termination shall entitle Licensee to a refund of any license fees or Product Support fees or other amounts paid by Licensee. Licensee may terminate this Agreement in the event of a material breach by Dundas and receive a refund of any unamortized license and support fees if Dundas fails to cure such default within thirty (30) days after Licensee provides Dundas with written notice of the default.

All provisions relating to confidentiality, Dundas (and its third party licensors and suppliers’) ownership and proprietary rights, limitations of liability, disclaimers of warranties, waivers and governing law shall survive the termination of this Agreement for any reason. 14. LIMITED WARRANTY: Dundas represents and warrants that the Software as delivered to Licensee will function substantially in accordance with the Documentation. Except for such warranty, and any other warranties contained herein or in any Documentation, the Software and Documentation are provided \"as is\". If for any reason Licensee is dissatisfied with the Software, Licensee may, within thirty (30) days after the date of license of the Software uninstall and destroy the Software and Documentation and confirm in writing to Dundas that the Software and Documentation has been so destroyed and upon receipt of such confirmation, Dundas shall provide Licensee with a full refund of any prepaid License fees.

Dundas represents and warrants to Licensee that the Software, as delivered by Dundas to Licensee, Clients or their customers, will not contain any virus, trojan horse, worm time bombs, trap door, or other harmful or malicious code (\"Destructive Elements”), and that Dundas will not install, use, or execute any Destructive Elements on any Licensee computers. DUNDAS DOES NOT WARRANT, GUARANTEE OR MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING THE USE, OR THE RESULTS OF USE, OF THE SOFTWARE OR DOCUMENTATION IN TERMS OF CORRECTNESS, ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, CURRENTNESS, OR OTHERWISE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE IS ASSUMED BY LICENSEE. DUNDAS DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL MEET LICENSEE’S REQUIREMENTS, THAT OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT ALL SOFTWARE ERRORS WILL BE CORRECTED. DUNDAS IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR PROBLEMS CAUSED BY CHANGES IN THE OPERATING 6 CHARACTERISTICS OF COMPUTER HARDWARE OR COMPUTER OPERATING SYSTEMS WHICH ARE MADE AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE SOFTWARE NOR FOR PROBLEMS IN THE INTERACTION OF THE SOFTWARE WITH NON-DUNDAS SOFTWARE (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY MODIFICATIONS, DERIVATIVE WORKS, ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONALITY OR OTHER CHANGES MADE TO THE SOFTWARE BY RESELLERS). DUNDAS WILL HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY TO REPLACE OR REFUND THE LICENSE FEE FOR MEDIA DAMAGED BY ACCIDENT, ABUSE OR MISAPPLICATION.

NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY DUNDAS, ITS EMPLOYEES, RESELLERS OR AGENTS SHALL INCREASE THE SCOPE OF THE ABOVE WARRANTIES OR CREATE ANY NEW WARRANTIES. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so the above exclusion may not apply to Licensee. In that event, any implied warranties or conditions are limited in duration to ninety (90) days from the date of delivery of the link for the Software. This warranty gives Licensee specific legal rights. Licensee may have other rights which vary from state to state and province to province. 15.

INFRINGEMENT INDEMNITY. Dundas will indemnify, hold harmless and defend at its own expense Licensee, its affiliates and their respective officers, directors and employees, against any action or litigation brought against it by any third party claim (\"Claim”) based upon a bona fide allegation that any Software, as delivered to Licensee by Dundas and arising from events occurring during the term of this Agreement, infringes upon patents, copyrights or trademarks in countries that are members of the Berne Convention, patents in Canada, the United States, Mexico or countries who are member states within the European Union, or that the Software incorporates any misappropriated trade secrets of any third party, provided that Dundas: (i) is notified promptly in writing of such Action; (ii) is given full and complete authority to control the defense and settlement of such Claim; and (iii) receives reasonable assistance from Licensee in connection with the defence. If the use of any Software is enjoined or if Dundas believes that such use may be enjoined by a court of competent jurisdiction, Dundas shall, at its option and expense, either promptly procure the right for Licensee to continue use of such Software, or, if the performance thereof will not be thereby materially adversely affected, promptly replace or modify such Software so that it becomes non-infringing (the “Work-Arounds\"). If neither of the foregoing are reasonably feasible to Dundas, upon written notice from Dundas, Dundas may terminate this Agreement and refund to Licensee the aggregate license fees paid for the allegedly infringing Software or the affected part thereof amortized on a straight-line basis over three (3) years. Upon receipt of such refund, Licensee shall return such Software to Dundas and Licensee's right to further use such Software shall cease and the License to such Software shall be deemed terminated. The obligations set out in this Section 25 9 shall not apply to the extent that any Claims are attributable to infringement caused by any unauthorized use or modification of the Software, continued use of the Software by Licensee after having been notified of the alleged infringement, or Licensee’s failure to use modifications to the Software supplied by Dundas that would have avoided the infringement.

Neither Dundas nor any Dundas affiliate or vendor will impose upon Licensee or any Licensee affiliate any requirement, or condition to purchasing or using any Software, that Licensee or the Licensee affiliate agree to any shrink wrap, click-wrap, Web-wrap, browse-wrap or other agreement that is to be made without signature by Licensee or the Licensee affiliate. The parties understand and agree that any such documents, terms and conditions will be only for (A) informational purposes or to set forth obligations of or rights granted by the Dundas or its Affiliates, (B) that neither Licensee nor any Licensee affiliate will be bound by any contractual obligation that might otherwise arise from any such reference or mechanism, whether under or in connection with the Agreement or otherwise, and (C) that any such documents, terms and conditions will in any event be subject and subordinate to the terms of the Agreement. 27.

Upon five (5) business days’ prior written notice, Licensee may verify Dundas’ compliance with this Agreement. Such verification will be conducted in a manner that minimizes disruption to Dundas' business. Licensee may use an independent auditor to assist with such verification, provided that Licensee has a written confidentiality agreement in place with such independent auditor. Dundas will provide to Licensee and its auditors accurate electronic and written records, system tool outputs, and other requested system information sufficient to provide verification that Dundas' billing invoices are accurate and in compliance with the Agreement.

FIS and Consultant will first attempt to resolve any dispute, difference, controversy or claim under this Agreement between their respective project managers identified in the Engagement Document. Each party shall escalate any and all unresolved disputes by notifying the other party in writing that it desires to elevate the matter to the FIS-designated executive officer of FIS and the Consultant-designated executive officer of Consultant for resolution. Upon receipt by the other party of such written notice, the matter shall be so elevated and the FIS- designated executive officer of FIS and the Consultant-designated executive officer of Consultant shall negotiate in good faith and each use its reasonable best efforts to resolve any remaining issues. The location, format, frequency, duration and conclusion of these elevated discussions shall be left to the discretion of the representatives involved. Upon mutual agreement, the representatives may utilize other alternative dispute resolution procedures to assist in the negotiations. All discussions and correspondence among the representatives for purposes of these negotiations shall be treated as Confidential Information developed for purposes of settlement, exempt from discovery and production, which shall not be admissible in any subsequent proceedings between the parties. Documents identified in or provided with such communications, which are not prepared for purposes of the negotiations, are not so exempted and may, if otherwise admissible, be admitted in evidence in such subsequent proceeding. If the disputed matter remains unresolved after the escalation procedure set forth above, then either party may, within thirty (30) calendar days after the representatives have met to address such matter, request binding arbitration of the issue in accordance with Section 20.2 below. 20.2 Alternative Dispute Resolution. FIS and Consultant will settle any dispute, difference, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the Agreement by binding arbitration before a single arbitrator in Jacksonville, Florida in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules (including Procedures for Large, Complex Commercial Disputes) of the American Arbitration Association. Judgment on any resulting award may be entered into by any court having jurisdiction over the parties or their respective property. The arbitrator will decide any issues submitted in accordance with the provisions and commercial purposes of the Agreement, and will not have the power to award damages in excess of the limitations set forth in, or damages excluded by, the Agreement. FIS and Consultant may elect to engage in non-binding mediation as a first alternative to binding arbitration or litigation as provided in this Section 20. Any such election must be mutual and reflected in a writing signed by both parties. Each party will bear its own costs in arbitration, and in any such mediation, and the parties will share equally all third party arbitration or mediation costs, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties. 21. Jurisdiction. Subject to the arbitration requirement set forth in Section 20 above, venue for any litigation arising out of or otherwise relating to the Agreement will be in state and federal courts of competent jurisdiction located in Duval County, Florida, which will have exclusive jurisdiction over such litigation. Nothing in the Agreement will prevent either party from seeking any stay of proceedings or preliminary or temporary injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction either to enforce the parties’ agreement to arbitrate or mediate any dispute under Section 20 above or to enjoin the other party’s breach of its information security or confidentiality obligations under the Agreement. THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE AGREEMENT. 22. Divestiture. FIS may partially assign the Agreement with respect to any Service or Deliverable used by an FIS Affiliate, or a division, department or other segment of FIS or an FIS Affiliate, that is the subject of a divestiture by FIS or an FIS Affiliate (regardless of the form of transaction) pursuant to a mutually acceptable partial assignment agreement between FIS or the FIS Affiliate, Consultant and the assignee. 23. Illegal Activities. With respect to the Agreement, Consultant covenants and agrees that neither it nor any of its directors, officers, agents, Consultant Personnel or other persons associated with or acting on behalf of it has made, will make, has given, or will give any payments or inducements, directly or indirectly, to any government officials in the jurisdictions in which Consultant conducts business in connection with any opportunity, agreement, license, permit, certificate, consent, order, approval, registration, waiver or other authorization relating to the business of Consultant, except for such payments or inducements as were lawful under the written Laws of such jurisdictions. With respect to the Agreement, Consultant covenants and agrees that neither Consultant nor any of its directors, officers or agents, nor any Consultant Personnel or other persons associated with or acting on behalf of Consultant: (i) has used, or will use any corporate funds for any unlawful contribution, gift, entertainment or other unlawful expense relating to political activity; (ii) has made, or will make any direct or indirect unlawful payment to any government official or employee from corporate funds; or (iii) has made, or will make any bribe, unlawful rebate, pay off, influence payment, kickback or other unlawful payment in connection with the business of Consultant. With respect to the Agreement, Consultant covenants and agrees that neither Consultant nor any of its directors, officers or agents, nor any Consultant Personnel or other persons associated with or acting on behalf of Consultant has violated, is in violation of, or will violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and any amendments thereto. Consultant additionally covenants and agrees that it will not retain any sub-agent, sub-contractor, or representative without the prior written consent of a senior executive officer of FIS. Consultant understands, acknowledges and agrees that FIS will have an irrevocable right to immediately terminate the Agreement as a result of any breach by Consultant of any such undertakings, representations, and agreements set forth herein. Master Consulting Services Agreement - General Terms Page 15 DocuSign Envelope ID: C85D0842-346C-4605-ACBC-7B5083CA7A8E 24. Financial Statements and Material Adverse Events. On or before the Effective Date, and annually thereafter during the Term, Consultant will provide to FIS a complete set of Consultant’s financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied which have been compiled, attested or audited by an independent certified public accounting firm. In the event FIS reasonably determines after review of such financial statements that Consultant’s financial condition is such that it may not allow Consultant to continue to perform all of its obligations under the Agreement, then FIS may terminate the Agreement, without penalty, by providing fifteen (15) days’ prior written notice to Consultant. Failure by Consultant to provide the required financial information to FIS in a timely manner will constitute a material breach of the Agreement. 25. Audit or Inspections. Consultant will keep complete, accurate, and up-to-date books and records in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and sound business practices covering all transactions relating to the Agreement. During the Term and for any period FIS is subject to examination with respect to the Services upon at least ten (10) business days prior written notice from FIS, Consultant or its agents will provide FIS, FIS’ agents, or any of FIS’ regulators , and any Client(s) receiving Services, with access to and any reasonable assistance that they may require with respect to any Consultant office or location where the Services are performed for the purposes of performing audits or inspections of the Services and the business of FIS relating to the Services. Such audits will be conducted by FIS, FIS’ agents, FIS’ regulators or Client(s) during regular business hours at any Consultant office or location where the Services are performed. If any audit by an auditor designated by FIS, a FIS agent or a regulatory authority results in Consultant being notified that Consultant or Consultant’s agents are not in compliance with any Law or any requirement of the Agreement, Consultant will remedy any such noncompliance within thirty (30) days. Consultant will bear the expense of any such compliance. Any audit hereunder will be subject to the following limitations: (i) use of any third party auditor that is a competitor of Consultant will be subject to Consultant’s prior written approval, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed; and (ii) FIS or any auditor conducting any such audit will at all times comply with any and all reasonable security and confidentiality guidelines and other policies of Consultant with respect to the audit. Consultant will have an independent third party annually prepare, and will make available to FIS, a Type II SOC 2 report concerning its operations, systems, controls and procedures, in accordance with Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) No. 18 and, at FIS’ written request, will electronically transmit to FIS a copy of Consultant’s latest SOC 2 report. 26. Subcontractors. Consultant will not utilize any Contractor to perform Services or provide any part of the Deliverable, without the prior written consent of FIS. Consultant will notify FIS of its intention to so engage another party not less than thirty (30) days prior to the entity commencing performance of any Services or to provide any part of the Deliverable. Consultant will provide such information and documentation concerning any such proposed party as FIS requests. Consultant will ensure that any such Contractor complies with all obligations of Consultant under the Agreement. Consultant is responsible for all of its obligations under the Agreement regardless of where performed or whether performed by any Contractor, and Consultant will be liable for the acts and omissions of any Contractor that Consultant uses to perform Services or provide any part of the Deliverable. 27. Force Majeure. 27.1 Except as expressly provided otherwise in the Agreement, and subject to the notification requirements below, the date by which a party is required to perform an obligation under the Agreement will be postponed automatically for the period of time that the performance is delayed by reason of a Force Majeure Event, exclusive of any delay the party could have avoided by reasonable precautions against the Force Majeure Event or by best efforts to work around its inability to perform or restore its ability to perform. 27.2 If a Force Majeure Event delays or threatens to delay a party’s performance of an obligation under the Agreement, the party will immediately notify the other party (i) in detail of the delay or anticipated delay and (ii) of any material changes in the circumstances of the delay, including the end of the cause for the delay. 27.3 A party whose performance is prevented by a Force Majeure Event will use its best efforts to perform in a timely manner, utilizing all resources reasonably required in the circumstances including, without limitation, obtaining reasonably available supplies and services from other resources. 27.4 This Section 27 does not relieve Consultant from its obligations to maintain and test disaster recovery plans for the Services. If a Force Majeure Event delays Consultant’s performance for more than two (2) business days then FIS may terminate the Engagement Document pursuant to Section 14.2 above, and no excuse of a performance delay due to a Force Majeure Event will preclude FIS from exercising such termination right. 28. Business Continuity Plan and Disaster Recovery. To the extent applicable to the Services under an Engagement Document, Consultant will establish and maintain disaster recovery and business continuity plans designed to minimize the risks associated with a disaster affecting Consultant’s ability to provide the Services, which includes off-site data storage and recovery infrastructure. Consultant’s recovery time objective for the Services (“RTO”) under such plan shall be set forth in the applicable Engagement Document. Consultant will maintain adequate backup procedures in order to recover FIS’ or if applicable any Client’s data to the point of the last available Master Consulting Services Agreement - General Terms Page 16 DocuSign Envelope ID: C85D0842-346C-4605-ACBC-7B5083CA7A8E good backup. Consultant’s recovery point objective (“RPO”) under such plan shall be set forth in the applicable Engagement Document. Consultant will test its disaster recovery and business continuity plans, including call trees, not less frequently than annually, will annually provide to FIS disaster recovery and business continuity plans test results. If Consultant fails to meet the RTO and RPO in any annual test, Consultant shall perform a root cause analysis of the cause of the failure to meet the RTO or RPO and will remediate the cause of such failure and retest within six (6) months of the failed test. If Consultant fails to meet the RTO or RPO in the retest, Consultant will have a second six (6) month period to remediate and retest. If provider fails a second time, FIS may request that the parties attempt to reach a mutually agreeable resolution, and if the parties are unable to agree upon a resolution within thirty (30) days of FIS’ request, FIS may terminate the Agreement or the applicable Engagement Document with no further financial obligation to Consultant. Consultant will provide its disaster recovery plan and test results to FIS and FIS may share such disaster recovery plan and test results with Clients who have contracted for the Services, if any, FIS’ auditors, and FIS’ regulators. Consultant will implement the applicable disaster recovery or business continuity plan upon the occurrence of a disaster, and shall notify FIS promptly following such event. In the event of a disaster (as defined in the plan), Consultant will not charge fees higher than or in addition to the agreed fees under the Agreement. Consultant will notify of, and invite FIS to participate in (at no additional charge to FIS), Consultant’s disaster recovery and business continuity plan test. 29. Miscellaneous. 29.1 Consultant will not subcontract, assign, subrogate or transfer any interest, obligation or right under the Agreement without the prior written consent from FIS. Any dissolution, merger, consolidation, reorganization or transfer of a majority of the assets or stock of Consultant will constitute an attempted assignment of the Agreement. Subject to the foregoing, the Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their successors or assigns. Consultant agrees that (a) any FIS Affiliate may obtain Services under the Agreement to the same extent as FIS has the right to do so, so long as it continues to be an FIS Affiliate, and (b) each FIS Affiliate is an intended, third party beneficiary of the Agreement and is entitled to rely upon all rights, representations and warranties made by Consultant herein to the same extent as if the FIS Affiliate were FIS hereunder. 29.2 The failure of either party to insist upon the performance of any terms or conditions of the Agreement, or to exercise any right or privilege conferred herein or therein, or to demand any relief at law or equity as a result of any breach hereof or thereof, will not be construed as the waiver or relinquishment of any such terms, conditions, damages, rights or privileges. No waiver of rights under the Agreement will be effective unless made in writing and signed by the party to be charged. No waiver of a breach of the Agreement will constitute a waiver of any prior or subsequent breach. 29.3 The parties hereto agree to perform all acts and execute all supplementary instruments or documents which may be necessary or desirable to carry out the provisions of the Agreement. 29.4 The division of the Agreement into sections, clauses, paragraphs or subdivisions, and the insertion of headings, are for convenience and reference only and will not affect the construction or interpretation of the provisions of the Agreement, and will not limit or extend its scope. In addition, the Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, and all of which will constitute one and the same instrument. 29.5 Consultant will not use FIS’ names, logos, trademarks or stock exchange ticker symbol, or in connection with the Agreement, those of any Client, unless pre-approved in writing by FIS. Consultant will not make any press release or other similar communication that mentions or implies a relationship between Consultant and FIS, or between Consultant and a Client in connection with the Agreement, unless pre-approved in writing by FIS. 29.6 The Agreement constitutes the entire understanding of the parties with respect to its subject matter and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings between the parties in their entirety. In the event of a conflict between these General Terms and the Agreement, these General Terms will prevail except to the extent the Engagement Document expressly modifies or removes any provision by specific reference(s) to the modified or removed provision(s). 29.7 The Agreement will not be construed more strongly against either party regardless of who is more responsible for its preparation. 29.8 If there is a conflict between a part of the Agreement and any present or future Law, the Agreement will be curtailed only to the extent necessary to bring it within the requirements of that Law. 29.9 English will be the language of the Agreement. Translation of the Agreement, its schedules, correspondence, documents, invoices, notices or other communications related to the Agreement, or the transactions thereunder, into another language will be at the sole risk of the translating party. In the event any conflicts arise between the English version of the Agreement and a translated version, the English version will prevail. If permitted under local Law, all communications pursuant to the Agreement will be conducted in the English language. Unless Master Consulting Services Agreement - General Terms Page 17 DocuSign Envelope ID: C85D0842-346C-4605-ACBC-7B5083CA7A8E the context clearly indicates otherwise, (i) references to a party’s agreement, consent, notice, request or approval mean written and signed agreement, consent, notice or approval, (ii) the words “will” and “shall” have the same meaning, which is obligatory, and (iii) the word “including” mean “including, without limitation” (so that it does not limit the scope of the word or phrase to which it is applied). 29.10 The Agreement may only be modified by written agreement of all parties. 29.11 Any provision of the Agreement which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction will, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or un-enforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions of the Agreement, and no such prohibition or un-enforceability in any jurisdiction will invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction. 29.12 The effectiveness of the Agreement, or of any Engagement Document made under the Agreement, will not be conditioned upon FIS becoming bound by (i) a reference in the Engagement Document to one or more documents maintained by Consultant and made available to FIS at a web page, by email distribution, or in any other manner or (ii) a “click-through”, “shrink wrap” or similar mechanism presented by Consultant (whether in the past, present or future) that involves the use of an action other than actual signature or electronic signature (as recognized by Law) to cause agreement to terms and conditions presented by Consultant. The parties understand and agree that any such documents, terms and conditions will be only for (A) informational purposes or to set forth obligations of or rights granted by the Consultant or its Affiliates, (B) that neither FIS nor any FIS Affiliate will be bound by any contractual obligation that might otherwise arise from any such reference or mechanism, whether under or in connection with the Agreement or otherwise, and (C) that any such documents, terms and conditions will in any event be subject to this Agreement. 29.13 The rights and obligations set forth in Section 3 (Fees and Other Payments), Section 9 (Safety and Security), Section 10 (Safeguarding of Information), Section 11 (Limitation of Liability), Section 13 (Indemnification), Section 17 (Compliance with Laws) and Section 20 (Alternative Dispute Resolution) of these General Terms, and those provisions of these General Terms which by their express terms extend beyond expiration of the Term or termination of the Engagement, or which by their nature so extend, will survive and continue in full force and effect after the expiration of the Term or the termination of the Engagement. Master Consulting Services Agreement - General Terms Page 18 DocuSign Envelope ID: C85D0842-346C-4605-ACBC-7B5083CA7A8E APPENDIX A - DATA PROTECTION ADDENDUM This Data Protection Addendum (the “Addendum”) is between [FIS entity] (“FIS”) acting on its own and as agent for the FIS Affiliates and [Provider entity] (“Provider”) acting on its own and as agent for the Provider Affiliates. The Addendum forms part of any written or electronic agreement(s) between Provider or an Provider Affiliate and FIS or a FIS Affiliate for the purchase of technology services pursuant to which Provider or an Provider Affiliate processes Personal Data for which FIS or a FIS Affiliate qualifies as a Controller (the “Agreement(s)“). The Addendum sets out obligations of FIS and Provider with respect to data protection in relation to the Agreement(s). FIS enters into this Addendum on behalf of itself and, to the extent required under applicable Data Protection Legislation, in the name and on behalf of its FIS Affiliates, if and to the extent Provider or an Provider Affiliate processes Personal Data for which such FIS Affiliates qualify as the Controller. For the purposes of this Addendum only, and except where indicated otherwise, the term \"FIS\" shall include FIS and FIS Affiliates and the term “Provider” shall include Provider and\/or where applicable Provider Affiliates. The parties hereto agree as follows: Definitions “Data Protection Legislation\" means GDPR and any legislation and\/or regulation implementing or made pursuant to them, or which amends, replaces, re-enacts or consolidates any of them, and all other applicable laws relating to Processing of Personal Data and privacy that may exist in any relevant jurisdiction, including, where applicable, the guidance and codes of practice issued by supervisory authorities; \"FIS Affiliate\" means an entity that owns or controls, is owned or controlled by or is or under common control or ownership with FIS, where control is defined as the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of an entity, whether through ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise; “Data” means any information or data to be processed by Provider pursuant to the Agreement(s) including any Personal Data, if applicable; \"Provider Affiliate\" means an entity: (a) that Processes Personal Data for which FIS or a FIS Affiliate qualifies as a Controller; and (b) which owns or controls, is owned or controlled by or is or under common control or ownership with Provider, where control is defined as the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of an entity, whether through ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise; “GDPR” means the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (Regulation (EU) 2016\/679); “Services” means technology services provided by Provider to FIS pursuant to an Agreement(s); “Standard Contractual Clauses” means the contractual clauses set out in EU Commission Decision C(2010)593 Standard Contractual Clauses (processors) for the purposes of Article 26(2) of Directive 95\/46\/EC (as amended and revised from time to time); The terms, “Controller\", \"Data Subject\", \"Personal Data\", \"Processing\" and “Processor” shall have the same meaning as in the GDPR, and their related terms shall be construed accordingly. Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the respective Agreement(s). Clauses 1. In the course of Provider providing the Services under the Agreement(s), FIS may from time-to-time provide or make available Data to Provider. The parties acknowledge and agree that, in relation to any Personal Data provided or made available to Provider for Processing by FIS under the Agreement(s), FIS will be the Controller and Provider will be a Processor for the purposes of the GDPR. 2. The Agreement(s) determines the subject matter and the duration of Provider’s Processing of Personal Data, as well as the nature and purpose of any collection, use and other Processing of Personal Data and the rights and obligations of FIS. Appendix 1 sets out the categories of Data Subjects and Personal Data Processed. 3. As required under the applicable Data Protection Legislation, the parties agree to incorporate the Standard Contractual Clauses into this Addendum, including the information set out in Annex 1 which is to be incorporated into such Standard Contractual Clauses for the purposes of this Addendum. In the event that the European Commission, any applicable data protection authority, or other body with competent authority and jurisdiction and\/or the analogous competent authority in the United Kingdom revises and thereafter publishes new Standard Contractual Clauses or as Master Consulting Services Agreement - General Terms Page 19 DocuSign Envelope ID: C85D0842-346C-4605-ACBC-7B5083CA7A8E otherwise required or implemented by such authority, such new Standard Contractual Clauses will supersede and replace the existing Standard Contractual Clauses. The European Economic Area (“EEA”) member state or the United Kingdom, as the case may be, where the data exporter is established shall be deemed inserted in Clause 9 and Clause 11 at the appropriate places, and the definition of “applicable data protection laws” shall be replaced with “with respect to any particular Data, the European Economic Area (EEA) member state, Swiss or United Kingdom legislation protecting the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals and in particular, their right to privacy with respect to the Processing of Personal Data, which is applicable to the Data Exporter.” Except as covered or permitted by the Standard Contractual Clauses, applicable law, or a country in respect of which a valid adequacy decision has been issued by the European Commission, as the case may be, Provider shall not Process Personal Data outside the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom. Subject to the last sentence hereof, the Standard Contractual Clauses shall also apply in relation to the Processing of Personal Data that is transferred from the EEA by FIS to Provider in the United Kingdom if the United Kingdom is neither: (a) subject to a transitional arrangement allowing the transfer of Personal Data to continue from the EEA to the United Kingdom without appropriate safeguards; (b) recognized by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of protection for Personal Data; nor (c) covered by an alternative framework recognized by the relevant authorities or the courts as providing an adequate level of protection for Personal Data. The Standard Contractual Clauses shall continue to apply until the earlier of: (a) the date upon which the European Commission issues a decision recognizing the United Kingdom as providing an adequate level of protection for EEA Personal Data; (b) the date upon which FIS adopts an alternative appropriate safeguarding measure for transfers from the EEA to the United Kingdom under Articles 46 to 49 of the GDPR; or (c) the date upon which Provider stops Processing Personal Data in the United Kingdom under the Agreement(s). 4. Provider shall Process the Personal Data only in accordance with the written instructions given by FIS from time to time as documented in and in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and not for any other purposes, particularly not for the Provider’s own purposes. Provider shall notify the FIS and the relevant FIS Affiliates immediately if, in the Provider's opinion, an instruction for the Processing of Personal Data given by FIS or the relevant FIS Affiliate infringes the GDPR or any other applicable Data Protection Legislation. 5. Provider shall ensure that all persons it authorizes to access the Personal Data have committed themselves to confidentiality in writing or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality. 6. Provider may not engage sub-Processors under the Agreement or give access to or transfer any Personal Data to any third party (including any affiliates, group companies or sub-contractors) without the prior written consent of FIS and the relevant FIS Affiliates. If FIS consents to the use of third parties as sub-Processors Provider shall (i) impose in writing upon such sub-Processors the same data protection obligations as set out herein and as are required by applicable Data Protection Legislation and (ii) be responsible for the acts and omissions of such sub  Processors under the Agreement. Where prior written consent given by FIS pursuant to this clause authorises a class of third party to Process Personal Data, the Provider shall notify FIS of any intended changes concerning the addition or replacement of any sub-Processors within such class, and FIS shall have the right to object to, and prevent, any such addition or replacement of sub-Processors within such class. 7. Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of Processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, Provider shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. As a minimum, these should include the requirements required under applicable Data Protection Legislation and the requirements set out in the Agreement. Upon request, Provider shall provide a written description of the technical and organizational measures the Provider employs for Processing Personal Data. 8. Provider shall take reasonable steps to ensure that any natural person acting under its authority who has access to Personal Data does not Process them except on instructions from it. 9. Upon FIS’s written request, Provider shall (at FIS’s choice) delete or return all Personal Data Processed on behalf of FIS to FIS after the end of the provision of Services relating to Processing, subject to Provider retaining any copies required by applicable EU member state law. 10. Provider shall cooperate with FIS as reasonably requested by FIS in order to assist FIS with its compliance with its legal obligations under Chapter III and pursuant to Articles 32 to 36 of the GDPR. 11. If Provider becomes aware of or has reason to assume any breach of security that has led to or is likely to lead to the accidental, unauthorized or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, or disclosure of, or access to the Personal Data that Provider Processes for FIS, Provider shall immediately (a) notify FIS thereof with all details describing the nature and cause of the breach, the affected type of Personal Data, the number of individuals possibly affected and the potential consequences; (b) at its own expense investigate the breach and to identify, prevent and mitigate the effects of the breach; and Master Consulting Services Agreement - General Terms Page 20 DocuSign Envelope ID: C85D0842-346C-4605-ACBC-7B5083CA7A8E (c) with the prior written approval of FIS, carry out any recovery or other action necessary to remedy the breach. Provider shall not release or publish any filing, communication, notice, press release, or report concerning the breach without FIS’ prior written approval (except where required to do so by law). 12. Where Provider is acting as a Processor under the Agreement, at FIS’s written request, Provider shall make available to FIS all information reasonably necessary to demonstrate Provider’ compliance with the obligations laid down in this Addendum and the applicable Data Protection Legislation. Provider shall allow FIS and its respective auditors or authorized agents to conduct audits or inspections during the term of the Agreement and for 12 months thereafter, which will include providing access to the premises, resources, personnel the Provider or the Provider's sub-contractors use in connection with the provision of the Services and provide all reasonable assistance in order to assist the Customer in exercising its audit rights under this clause 12. The purposes of an audit pursuant to this clause 12 include verifying that the Provider and its subcontractors are Processing Personal Data in accordance with the obligations under this Agreement and the applicable Data Protection Legislation. *** Master Consulting Services Agreement - General Terms Page 21 DocuSign Envelope ID: C85D0842-346C-4605-ACBC-7B5083CA7A8E ANNEX 1 Standard Contractual Clauses The Standard Contractual Clauses (excluding the optional parts thereof) are hereby incorporated into this Addendum.

Each party shall escalate any and all unresolved disputes by notifying the other party in writing that it desires to elevate the matter to the FIS-designated executive officer of FIS and the Consultant-designated executive officer of Consultant for resolution. Upon receipt by the other party of such written notice, the matter shall be so elevated and the FIS- designated executive officer of FIS and the Consultant-designated executive officer of Consultant shall negotiate in good faith and each use its reasonable best efforts to resolve any remaining issues. The location, format, frequency, duration and conclusion of these elevated discussions shall be left to the discretion of the representatives involved. Upon mutual agreement, the representatives may utilize other alternative dispute resolution procedures to assist in the negotiations. All discussions and correspondence among the representatives for purposes of these negotiations shall be treated as Confidential Information developed for purposes of settlement, exempt from discovery and production, which shall not be admissible in any subsequent proceedings between the parties. Documents identified in or provided with such communications, which are not prepared for purposes of the negotiations, are not so exempted and may, if otherwise admissible, be admitted in evidence in such subsequent proceeding.

Each party will bear its own costs in arbitration, and in any such mediation, and the parties will share equally all third party arbitration or mediation costs, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties. 21. Jurisdiction. Subject to the arbitration requirement set forth in Section 20 above, venue for any litigation arising out of or otherwise relating to the Agreement will be in state and federal courts of competent jurisdiction located in Duval County, Florida, which will have exclusive jurisdiction over such litigation. Nothing in the Agreement will prevent either party from seeking any stay of proceedings or preliminary or temporary injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction either to enforce the parties’ agreement to arbitrate or mediate any dispute under Section 20 above or to enjoin the other party’s breach of its information security or confidentiality obligations under the Agreement. THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE AGREEMENT. 22. Divestiture.

In the event that the European Commission, any applicable data protection authority, or other body with competent authority and jurisdiction and\/or the analogous competent authority in the United Kingdom revises and thereafter publishes new Standard Contractual Clauses or as Master Consulting Services Agreement - General Terms Page 19 DocuSign Envelope ID: 42B25783-4B1F-4CA2-995D-8EDA2FA4407C otherwise required or implemented by such authority, such new Standard Contractual Clauses will supersede and replace the existing Standard Contractual Clauses. The European Economic Area (“EEA”) member state or the United Kingdom, as the case may be, where the data exporter is established shall be deemed inserted in Clause 9 and Clause 11 at the appropriate places, and the definition of “applicable data protection laws” shall be replaced with “with respect to any particular Data, the European Economic Area (EEA) member state, Swiss or United Kingdom legislation protecting the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals and in particular, their right to privacy with respect to the Processing of Personal Data, which is applicable to the Data Exporter.” Except as covered or permitted by the Standard Contractual Clauses, applicable law, or a country in respect of which a valid adequacy decision has been issued by the European Commission, as the case may be, Provider shall not Process Personal Data outside the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom. Subject to the last sentence hereof, the Standard Contractual Clauses shall also apply in relation to the Processing of Personal Data that is transferred from the EEA by FIS to Provider in the United Kingdom if the United Kingdom is neither: (a) subject to a transitional arrangement allowing the transfer of Personal Data to continue from the EEA to the United Kingdom without appropriate safeguards; (b) recognized by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of protection for Personal Data; nor (c) covered by an alternative framework recognized by the relevant authorities or the courts as providing an adequate level of protection for Personal Data. The Standard Contractual Clauses shall continue to apply until the earlier of: (a) the date upon which the European Commission issues a decision recognizing the United Kingdom as providing an adequate level of protection for EEA Personal Data; (b) the date upon which FIS adopts an alternative appropriate safeguarding measure for transfers from the EEA to the United Kingdom under Articles 46 to 49 of the GDPR; or (c) the date upon which Provider stops Processing Personal Data in the United Kingdom under the Agreement(s). 4. Provider shall Process the Personal Data only in accordance with the written instructions given by FIS from time to time as documented in and in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and not for any other purposes, particularly not for the Provider’s own purposes. Provider shall notify the FIS and the relevant FIS Affiliates immediately if, in the Provider's opinion, an instruction for the Processing of Personal Data given by FIS or the relevant FIS Affiliate infringes the GDPR or any other applicable Data Protection Legislation. 5. Provider shall ensure that all persons it authorizes to access the Personal Data have committed themselves to confidentiality in writing or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality. 6. Provider may not engage sub-Processors under the Agreement or give access to or transfer any Personal Data to any third party (including any affiliates, group companies or sub-contractors) without the prior written consent of FIS and the relevant FIS Affiliates. If FIS consents to the use of third parties as sub-Processors Provider shall (i) impose in writing upon such sub-Processors the same data protection obligations as set out herein and as are required by applicable Data Protection Legislation and (ii) be responsible for the acts and omissions of such sub  Processors under the Agreement. Where prior written consent given by FIS pursuant to this clause authorises a class of third party to Process Personal Data, the Provider shall notify FIS of any intended changes concerning the addition or replacement of any sub-Processors within such class, and FIS shall have the right to object to, and prevent, any such addition or replacement of sub-Processors within such class. 7. Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of Processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, Provider shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. As a minimum, these should include the requirements required under applicable Data Protection Legislation and the requirements set out in the Agreement. Upon request, Provider shall provide a written description of the technical and organizational measures the Provider employs for Processing Personal Data. 8. Provider shall take reasonable steps to ensure that any natural person acting under its authority who has access to Personal Data does not Process them except on instructions from it. 9. Upon FIS’s written request, Provider shall (at FIS’s choice) delete or return all Personal Data Processed on behalf of FIS to FIS after the end of the provision of Services relating to Processing, subject to Provider retaining any copies required by applicable EU member state law. 10. Provider shall cooperate with FIS as reasonably requested by FIS in order to assist FIS with its compliance with its legal obligations under Chapter III and pursuant to Articles 32 to 36 of the GDPR. 11. If Provider becomes aware of or has reason to assume any breach of security that has led to or is likely to lead to the accidental, unauthorized or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, or disclosure of, or access to the Personal Data that Provider Processes for FIS, Provider shall immediately (a) notify FIS thereof with all details describing the nature and cause of the breach, the affected type of Personal Data, the number of individuals possibly affected and the potential consequences; (b) at its own expense investigate the breach and to identify, prevent and mitigate the effects of the breach; and Master Consulting Services Agreement - General Terms Page 20 DocuSign Envelope ID: 42B25783-4B1F-4CA2-995D-8EDA2FA4407C (c) with the prior written approval of FIS, carry out any recovery or other action necessary to remedy the breach. Provider shall not release or publish any filing, communication, notice, press release, or report concerning the breach without FIS’ prior written approval (except where required to do so by law). 12. Where Provider is acting as a Processor under the Agreement, at FIS’s written request, Provider shall make available to FIS all information reasonably necessary to demonstrate Provider’ compliance with the obligations laid down in this Addendum and the applicable Data Protection Legislation. Provider shall allow FIS and its respective auditors or authorized agents to conduct audits or inspections during the term of the Agreement and for 12 months thereafter, which will include providing access to the premises, resources, personnel the Provider or the Provider's sub-contractors use in connection with the provision of the Services and provide all reasonable assistance in order to assist the Customer in exercising its audit rights under this clause 12. The purposes of an audit pursuant to this clause 12 include verifying that the Provider and its subcontractors are Processing Personal Data in accordance with the obligations under this Agreement and the applicable Data Protection Legislation. ★ ★★ Master Consulting Services Agreement - General Terms Page 21 DocuSign Envelope ID: 42B25783-4B1F-4CA2-995D-8EDA2FA4407C ANNEX 1 Standard Contractual Clauses The Standard Contractual Clauses (excluding the optional parts thereof) are hereby incorporated into this Addendum.

This is also applicable to every other asset with the exception on Skybox. If however we add three new Websense assets\/appliances there will be an incremental service cost above the 10% rule, in this example case of three: The service would accept the 10% uplift of two assets, but the difference of one asset would incur an uplift in overall service cost which would be agreed under change control. 3 Managed Device Service Overview 3.1 Purpose The purpose of the Managed Device service is to provide a full device monitoring and management service, which will ensure that all in scope platforms are active, maintained, optimised and delivering the expected levels of protection and\/or data.

K SERVICE CREDITS Refund payable for SLA breaches 5.1 Service Credits shall apply as set out in Section 5.2 below for ‘Short SLAs’ and Section 5.3 for ‘Long SLAs’. Such terms are defined as follows: 5.1.1 SLAs defined as ‘Short SLAs’ are as follows; • Device Monitoring and System Availability • System Access Management • Fault Resolution Software • Fault Resolution Hardware • Security Incident Investigation Support - Business Hours • Security Incident Investigation Support - Out of Hours Support 5.1.2 SLAs defined as ‘Long SLAs’ are as follows; • Device Software Maintenance • Signature and Security Content Updates • Device Vulnerability Patching 5.2 Service credits shall be applied for breaches of ‘Short’ SLAs as set out in 5.2.1 and 5.2.2 below: 5.2.1 In the event that an SLA is missed, the period will be rounded up to the nearest full hour. For example: If the SLA has been exceeded by 42 minutes this will be rounded up to 60 minutes. 5.2.2 The Service Credit paid is equivalent to a full day of service revenue for each hour that the SLA is exceeded. For example, if the SLA is exceeded by 3 hours then the DocuSign Envelope ID: C9996D05-E738-4980-8602-B648C9135FFB Service Credit shall be 3 days service revenue. The Daily service revenue is calculated as the total annual cost of the individual service, divided by 365 days. Refund example: Device Monitoring and System Availability SLA: Target Notification 2 Business Hours Actual response time following an Incident: 162 minutes Minutes SLA Exceeded: 42 minutes Hours SLA exceeded (rounded up to nearest full hour): 60 Minutes (1 hour) Cost of Protective Monitoring Service per year: £605,847.88 Cost of Service per day: £605,847.88\/365 = £1,659.86 per day Total refund payable: [Hours SLA Exceeded] x [Cost of Service p.d.] (1 x £1,659.86) = £1,659.86 5.3 Service Credits shall be applied for breaches of ‘Long’ SLAs as set out in 5.3.1: 5.3.1 In the event that an SLA is missed by a period of 3 Working Days in any calendar month, Service Credits shall be refunded in the amount of one full day of service revenue The Daily service revenue is calculated as the total annual cost of the individual service, divided by 365 days. For each incremental 3 days missed an additional payment of one full day of service revenue shall be refunded. Refund example: ‘Long’ SLA Actual SLA days missed in one month: 4 days Cost of Service per year: £605,847.88 Cost of Service per day: £605,847.88\/365 = £1,659.86 per day Total refund payable: [Cost of Service p.d.] = £1,659.86 5.4 It is the responsibility of Worldpay to request a Service Credit be paid if it believes that the SLA has been missed and it is the responsibility of the Supplier to pay the relevant Service Credit where an SLA has been missed.

ActiveGuard® Monitoring Only Services Solutionary will utilize ActiveGuard to perform monitoring and analysis of designated FIS device(s) using existing Log Transport Agents (LTAs) to retrieve log feeds and existing Classifiers to parse the log information. Solutionary will monitor the above devices via feeds directly from devices. 2. ActiveGuard® Monitoring and Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) Management Service. Solutionary will manage and utilize ActiveGuard to perform monitoring analysis of designated FIS devices using existing Log Transport Agents (LTAs) to retrieve log feeds and existing Classifiers to parse the log information. Solutionary will monitor the above devices via feeds directly from the device(s). All of Solutionary’s ActiveGuard .monitoring Service Levels include monitoring of Security Logs. Log messages pertaining to authorized traffic such as firewall accepts, allows, connection tracking, and log verbosity intended for troubleshooting purposes are not included in Security Log monitoring. Solutionary offers monitoring of these additional Logs for an additional fee and will work with Client to amend the scope of work accordingly if appropriate. 3. Vulnerability Threat Correlation (VTC) Services Solutionary will provide FIS with the ActiveGuard VTC feature as follows: 3.1 FIS may import scan results for up to the quantity of IP Addresses and\/or Fully Qualified Domain Names documented in respective Order Forms. 3.2 Scanning results feed into the ActiveGuard Security and Compliance platform for automatic Threat Correlation with Solutionary’s AG Monitoring service automatically. Threat Correlation involves two tiers of correlation support: • Automatic Threat Correlation -Correlates SCEs between the monitoring and scanning data to increase the severity of detected monitoring events with the supplied vulnerability scan data. ■ • Manual Threat Correlation - Used by the SOC in manual analysis of events to understand the risk profile of a box relative to the attack type to allow for better analysis and risk assessment of the attack. 3.3 Scan Vendor Support: • 3rd party scan data is only supported for approved Vendors and contingent upon designation in the SO. Solutionary currently supports Qualys, Nessus, Saint, Rapid?, Retina, Foundstone (McAfee) and IP360 (Tripwire) scanning file formats. • Client is responsible for managing the importing and loading of 3rd party scan data (unless otherwise specified in the SO) into the ActiveGuard portal using the supplied Solutionary ActiveGuard Portal tools. Load tools vary by 3rd Party Scan manufacturer. • Client is responsible for ensuring that accepted 3rd party scan data is exported in the accepted compatible Solutionary format. ' • Solutionary does not guarantee the functionality of the load process as 3rd party vendors can at their discretion change the formatting or content of reports breaking the load process. Solutionary will work with the client in good faith to adjust and fix any load issues. Solutionary does not guarantee the accuracy of 3rd party data imported into the system Data retention for the purpose of Threat Correlation will be in accordance with Solutionary’s standard ActiveGuard data retention policy. 4. Unsupported Devices 2.1 Solutionary will monitor the following devices at the ActiveGuard High Priority Alerting (HPA) service level. The following terms apply: 2.1.1 In order to receive and process log feeds from sources (e.g., device, application, OS, database, etc.) not currently on Solutionary’s Supported Device List (SDL), Solutionary typically requires a Technical Information Exchange (TIE), including source documentation (e.g„ administrative guide, user guide, etc.) and sample log data sent though the ActiveGuard appliance. Once this is complete, Solutionary develops a new Classifier and associated Solutionary Common Events (SCE) mappings, which typically takes SO¬ SO days. 2.1.2 Source vendors may require SunGard (as their customer) to initiate necessary support calls to assist with configuration\/troubleshooting. In the event a new Log Transport Agent (LTA) is required (i.e., either in¬ scope sources are not equipped to provide log data in a standard Syslog, SNMP consumable manner, or Solutionary supported third party LTAs are not able to be utilized) or available logs are problematic (i.e., require multiple sources, require maintenance of state, or are incomplete), SunGard agrees to work with Solutionary to amend the \"Scope of Work \"accordingly. 2.1.3 FIS agrees to provide knowledgeable technical staff and\/or third party resources to assist Solutionary with Classifier and LTA development and configuration. SunGard agrees to initiate and participate in support calls with source vendors, to assist with the technical scoping necessary for Solutionary to understand the Level of Effort (LOE) associated with successfully processing log feeds. Once SunGard and the Source vendors complete the TIE with Solutionary, the new LTA, Classifier, and associated SCE mappings are developed in accordance with the LOE and any executed amendment to the \"Scope of Work\". . 5. Management of NIDS\/ActiveGuard Examiners devices. FIS understands Solutionary does not have visibility to Medium and Low Event priorities at the HPA service level and Solutionary does not support device management for devices being monitored at the HPA service level. FIS has requested Solutionary to make an exception and provide device management for FIS at the HPA service level (the \"Exception Services”). Solutionary is willing to accommodate the request with the understanding Solutionary shall have no responsibility for any negative consequences associated with making this accommodation. FIS understands Solutionary is not responsible for loss of business or other consequences incurred by FIS due to the performance of the Exception Services and agrees not to instigate any type of prosecution or breach claims against Solutionary as directly related to the performance of the Exception Services. 6. Professional Security Services. Client and Solutionary will enter into a specific Statement of Work (SO) for agreed upon by both parties for Professional Security Services 7. Out-of-pocket expenses. Solutionary will bill applicable out-of-pocket expenses at actual cost to Client. Solutionary will make every attempt to incur reasonable expenses associated with the inqplementation projects. Valid out out-of-pocket expenses may include, but are not limited to, airfare, lodging, a per diem for meals and incidental expenses, mileage (If a personal car is used), automobile rental, parking and tolls.

For purposes of this Agreement, the party providing Confidential Information (as that term is defined below), and such party’s employees, agents and affiliates shall be referred to as the “Disclosing Party” and the party receiving the Confidential Information and such party’s employees, agents and affiliates shall be referred to as the “Receiving Party.” 1. INTRODUCTION. The parties may disclose Confidential Information to each other during discussions to evaluate a potential business relationship (the “Purpose”) and the parties agree that this Agreement relates only to the Confidential Information disclosed in connection with the Purpose. 2. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. 2.1 “Confidential Information” may include the Disclosing Party’s intellectual property, clients, customer lists, business contacts, business plans, policies, procedures, techniques, know-how, standards, products, source or object code, product or service specifications, manuals, agreements, economic and financial information, marketing plans, data, reports, analyses, compilations, statistics, summaries, studies, and any other tangible or intangible information or any materials based thereon, furnished directly or indirectly by the Disclosing Party. In addition, Confidential Information includes (i) any technical or business information of a third person furnished or disclosed by one party to the other and (ii) the fact that a potential business relationship is being discussed. Confidential Information does not include information which (i) was previously known by the Receiving Party, (ii) was or becomes publicly available through no breach by the Receiving Party, (iii) was or becomes available from a third party to whom the Confidential Information was disclosed without any known restrictions; or (iv) was independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information. 2.2 The Receiving Party shall: (i) keep all Confidential Information strictly confidential and shall not, without the Disclosing Party’s prior written consent, use or disclose Confidential Information other than as for the Purpose and as permitted by this Agreement; (ii) use the same degree of care to protect the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information as it uses to safeguard its own; and (iii) establish procedural, physical and electronic safeguards to prevent the compromise or unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information consistent with the guidelines, standards or governing laws that may apply to the respective party. The Receiving Party may reveal Confidential Information only to employees, agents and affiliates who: (i) need to know the Confidential Information for the Purpose; and (ii) have been informed of and agreed to abide by the terms of this Agreement. The Receiving Party may be subject to fines, penalties and other liabilities under applicable law if the Receiving Party, based on Confidential Information, trades in the capital stock of the Disclosing Party or advises others to do so. The parties shall be free to disclose the tax treatment or tax structure of any transaction under this Agreement. Confidential Information shall remain the property of the Disclosing Party. The Receiving Party shall not modify, decompile, disassemble or otherwise reverse engineer or create derivative works from the Confidential Information or any portion thereof, or extract or attempt to extract any source code, algorithms, methods or techniques embodied in the Confidential Information or any portion thereof. The Receiving Party agrees not to utilize, exploit or in any other manner whatsoever to use the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to obtain a commercial, trading or other advantage for any person or in a way which is, directly or indirectly, detrimental to the Disclosing Party. The Receiving Party agrees that it will be liable for the acts, omissions and defaults of all persons with whom it shares Confidential Information, and will assume responsibility for compliance by such persons with the terms of this Agreement. 2.3 Nothing herein shall constitute a commitment to the development or release of any future products or the entry into any form of business relationship or be construed as granting any right or license under any copyright, patent, trademark or any other intellectual property right, now or hereafter owned or controlled by the Disclosing Party. Each party’s right to develop, use, and market products and services similar to or competitive with the Confidential Information of the other party shall remain unimpaired. The parties acknowledge that the other may have had or may have in the future, discussions with others concerning subject matters similar to the potential business transaction discussed hereunder and may receive information from others similar to the Confidential Information. 2.4 Upon the first to occur of (i) completion of the Purpose or (ii) Disclosing Party’s written request, Receiving Party shall promptly return or destroy, at Receiving Party’s election, all material to the extent containing or reflecting any information contained in the Confidential Information (including, without limitation, any documents, memoranda, notes, or other writings whatsoever, prepared and based on the information contained in the Confidential Information) and will not retain any copies, extracts, or other reproductions in whole or in part of such written material; provided, however, Receiving Party may retain: (a) any Confidential Information in its possession that (i) has been automatically saved electronically as part of a computer archival, disaster recovery or similar back-up system or (ii) constitute memory dumps, swap files, temporary files, printer spool files and metadata that can customarily only be retrieved by computer forensics experts and are generally considered inaccessible without the use of specialized tools and techniques; and (b) Confidential Information as required to comply with applicable legal or regulatory obligations. All such retained Confidential Information shall continue to be subject to the confidentiality and use obligations hereunder. If the Receiving Party elects to destroy Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information, upon Disclosing Party’s request, the 1 Doc ID: 89feba98d9d77cca2137eabe7e1efc6a19cd767f Receiving Party will provide reasonable substantiation of such destruction. The requirements of confidentiality set forth in this Agreement shall survive for a period of five (5) years from the Effective Date (except with respect to any trade secrets where such obligations will be for so long as such information remains a trade secret under applicable law). 2.5 If the Receiving Party or any third party becomes legally compelled pursuant to legal or government requirements or by law, regulation or legal or judicial process to disclose any of the Confidential Information, the Receiving Party to the extent legally permissible shall promptly notify the Disclosing Party to enable the Disclosing Party to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy. If such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, the Receiving Party shall furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information that is legally required and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded the Confidential Information. 2.6 ALL CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION FURNISHED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS PROVIDED BY THE DISCLOSING PARTY “AS IS” AND “WITH ALL FAULTS.” THE DISCLOSING PARTY DOES NOT MAKE ANY WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, REGARDING THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, PERFORMANCE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR USE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT OF ANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, OR ANY RIGHT OF PRIVACY, ANY RIGHTS OF THIRD PERSONS OR OTHER ATTRIBUTES OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. ANY RELIANCE ON CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION WILL BE EXCLUSIVELY AT THE RECEIVING PARTY’S OWN RISK AND THE DISCLOSING PARTY IS NOT RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY BUSINESS DECISIONS MADE OR INFERENCES DRAWN BY THE RECEIVING PARTY IN RELIANCE ON ANY DISCLOSURES MADE PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. 3.

Confidential Information does not include information which (i) was or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by Representative\/Subcontractor or its employees, directors, attorneys or accountants (collectively “Representative\/Subcontractor Representatives”); or (ii) was or becomes rightfully available to Representative\/Subcontractor, or was in Representative\/Subcontractor’s rightful possession, on a non-confidential basis from a source other than FIS or FIS’ Representatives, provided that such source is not bound by a confidentiality agreement with FIS. 2.
