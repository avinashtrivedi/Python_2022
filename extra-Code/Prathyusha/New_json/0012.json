If, after reviewing such test results, FIS believes that additional testing is warranted, Provider will discuss such additional testing with FIS in good faith. (4) Provider will notify FIS of any and all breaches to Provider’s information security and work with FIS management to identify the root cause of the incident and the potential impact to FIS, its Clients or their customers, as reasonably requested by FIS.

In addition, to the extent permitted by Law, the background check will include a 9-panel drug test and criminal record search. For the drug test, all specimens will be tested at a Department of Health and Human Services\/Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration certified lab, and the screening service will include confirmation of all positive test results. The criminal record search will include, to the maximum extent permitted by Law, a federal, state and county check, and a National Criminal File check, for felony and misdemeanor convictions for the last ten (10) years in all locations where the individual has resided for the last ten (10) years. Provider will comply with all applicable Laws related to the background check, including required notices and applicable consents. In addition, Provider will require the individual to report any criminal convictions. Provider will not assign anyone to perform Services for FIS who has tested positive for drugs or whose background check findings do not meet the standards established by Provider in accordance with all applicable Laws, including if there is a conviction or referral to a pretrial diversion program for a crime that is related to his or her duties.

It is critical that frequent and normal check points are established and the organization on the whole maintains the discipline to work through issues that impede progress and growth along the way.\nApproach ■ Establish frequent and formal performance and organizational health check points along the way • Roadblocks\/immediate pain points that impede progress need to be addressed FIRST\nFeedback Loop • What's working\/not working? • What's getting in the way? • What do we need to do? • Who else do we need to involve? • When do we re-evaluate?\nDocuSign Envelope ID: B890B97E-27EF-4EC6-B67E-04428E6A11D4 Phases of development SUSTAINABILITY: Creating sustainability with the senior leader and his\/her stakeholder Perspectiv All change initiatives need time to develop and prove sustainability. Dropping\nE leadership development too soon can result in a \"honeymoon\" period where the senior leader can revert to old habits.

In the event of a breach of the warranties set forth in this Section 4.1, Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy will be that Saba shall, upon receipt of written notice of breach, make diligent efforts to modify the Services to be compliant with the warranties set forth in this Section 4.1, and if Saba does not do so within a reasonable period of time, Customer will be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.2. 4.2 Service Level Warranty. (a) “Available” or “Availability” shall mean that the Subscription Services are responsive and available for use at the URL specified by Saba. Availability is measured 24x7, on a calendar monthly basis. Unavailability does not mean an inability to connect to the Subscription Services due to (i) a failure between Customer’s computer(s) and the Internet; (ii) factors outside of Saba’s reasonable control; (iii) Customer’s action or inaction, or any action or inaction of Customer’s Users; or (iv) scheduled maintenance periods and necessary but unscheduled maintenance of which Customer has reasonable notice. (b) “Category 1” shall mean that the Subscription Services are not Available (i.e. a “system down” support issue). (c) “Category 2” shall mean that an entire application module (as defined in the standard end user documentation for the Subscription Services) of the Subscription Services is inaccessible or unusable. (d) “Report” shall mean submitting Customer’s issue via the electronic interface to Saba’s support tracking system, or in a telephonic conversation with a Saba support representative during a time period when support is available to Customer, based on the edition of the Subscription Services that Customer has purchased (e) “Resolve” or “Resolution” shall mean that Saba has tested the affected module(s), and has notified Customer electronically or telephonically that the module is accessible and usable. (f) “Respond” or “Response” shall mean an electronic or telephonic notification to Customer, confirming that Saba has logged Customer’s issue in Saba’s support tracking system. (g) “Service Credit” shall mean a credit calculated as specified in Section 4.2.2 below. A Service Credit shall be issued by discounting Customer’s next payment for the Subscription Services by the amount of the Service Credit. 4.2.1 Service Level Agreement. Saba warrants that support for the Subscription Services shall be provided consistent with the following Service Level Agreement (“SLA’): 4.2.1.1 Availability SLA. Saba’s target is 100% Availability of the Subscription Services. If Customer experiences a Category 1 issue or issues resulting in less than 99.5% Availability, Customer is eligible for a Service Credit as set forth in Section 4.2.2.1. 4.2.1.2 Response and Resolution SLA. For all Category 2 issues, Saba commits to Respond to the issue within one (1) hour, and to Resolve the issue within twenty-four (24) hours. If Saba does not Respond to and\/or Resolve a Category 2 issue within the defined time interval, Customer is eligible for a Service Credit as set forth in Section 4.2.2.2. 4.2.2 Service Credits. 4.2.2.1 Category 1 \/ Unavailability. In the event Customer experiences less than 99.5% Availability in one calendar month, Customer may request a Service Credit from Saba. The amount of the Service Credit shall be calculated by multiplying Customer’s monthly Subscription Services fees for said Subscription Services for the calendar month in which the Service Credit was incurred, by the percentage shown in the table below that corresponds to the actual Availability of said Subscription Services during that month. Availability Percentage Percentage Credit\n99% or over, but below 99.5% 25%\n95% or over but below 99% 50%\nBelow 95% 100%\n4.2.2.2 Category 2. In the event that Customer reports a Category 2 issue, and Saba does not Respond within the defined Response time, Customer may request a Service Credit from Saba. The Service Credit shall be calculated by multiplying Customer’s monthly Subscription Services fees for the affected Subscription Services for the calendar month in which the Service Credit was incurred by three percent (3%). Customer may request an additional 3% Service Credit for each additional, consecutive 24-hour period during which Saba does not Respond to Customer. In the event that Customer reports a Category 2 issue, and Saba does not Resolve the issue within the defined Resolution time, Customer may request a Service Credit from Saba. The Service Credit shall be calculated by multiplying Customer’s monthly Subscription Services fees for the affected Subscription Services for the calendar month in which the Service Credit was incurred by three percent (3%). Customer may request an additional 3% Service Credit for each additional, consecutive 24-hour period during which Saba does not Resolve the issue. 4.2.2.3 This Service Level Warranty applies only to Customer’s production environment of the Subscription Services, and not to any development, staging, testing, QA or other non-production environment. Response and Resolution shall be measured from the time stamp recorded in Saba’s support tracking system at the time that the issue is submitted electronically by Customer (or, if Customer contacts Saba telephonically, the time at which Saba creates the case describing the issue in the system). Response and Resolution times are calculated only during time periods when support is available to Customer, based on the edition of the Subscription Services that Customer has purchased. Time periods during which Saba is awaiting a response or information requested from Customer shall not be counted in Resolution time calculations. Customer may specify the category associated with an issue when Customer reports the issue, but Saba may change the category after investigation of the issue. The Service Level Warranty applies to the Subscription Services and all published Saba APIs, but not to any customization, developed applications or extensions. 4.2.3 Customer Must Request Service Credit. If Customer believes Customer is eligible for a Service Credit for any given calendar month, or has a right to terminate as described in Section 4.2.5, Customer must notify Saba in writing within 5 business days from the end of the month in order to receive a Service Credit or exercise Customer’s right of termination. September 2013 Saba Cloud SPC Confidential 2 4.2.4 Maximum Service Credit. Customer’s aggregate Service Credits in any single calendar month may not exceed Customer’s monthly Subscription Services fees for the calendar month in which the Service Credit(s) were incurred. 4.2.5 Termination Option for Chronic Problems. If, in each of three (3) consecutive months, Customer experiences less than 99.5% Availability, and\/or Customer accrues Service Credits for Category 2 issues totaling twenty-five percent (25%) or more of Customer’s monthly Subscription Service fees for each of the three (3) months, this Agreement may be terminated without penalty. Such termination will be effective thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice of termination. Upon termination, Saba will refund any subscription fees pre-paid by Customer, pro-rated for the remainder of Customer’s Subscription Term after the effective date of termination. This Section 4.2 states Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy for any failure by Saba to make the Services available. 4.3 No Other Warranty. Except for the express warranties set FORTH IN THIS SECTION 4, THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS, AND CUSTOMER’S USE OF THE SERVICES IS AT Customer’s own risk. Saba does not make, and hereby disclaims, ANY AND ALL OTHER EXPRESS AND\/OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT AND TITLE, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING FROM A COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE, OR TRADE PRACTICE. SABA DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, OR COMPLETELY SECURE. 4.4 Disclaimer of Actions Caused by and\/or Under the Control of Third Parties. Saba does not and cannot control the flow of data to or from Saba’s network and other portions of the internet. Such flow depends in large part on the performance of Internet SERVICES PROVIDED OR CONTROLLED BY THIRD PARTIES. AT TIMES, ACTIONS OR INACTIONS OF SUCH THIRD PARTIES CAN IMPAIR OR DISRUPT Customer’s connections to the Internet (or portions thereof). Although Saba will use commercially reasonable efforts to REMEDY AND AVOID SUCH EVENTS, SABA CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT SUCH EVENTS WILL NOT OCCUR. ACCORDINGLY, SABA DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL LIABILITY RESULTING FROM OR RELATED TO SUCH EVENTS. 5. Customer’s Obligations. 5.1 Customer’s Representations and Warranties. Customer represents and warrants that (i) Customer has the legal right and authority, and will continue to own or maintain the legal right and authority, during the term of this Agreement, to place and use any Content as contemplated under this Agreement; and (ii) Customer’s performance of Customer’s obligations, and all use of the Services by Customer and Customer’s Users, will not violate any applicable laws, regulations, or the prohibitions in Sections 5.2 and 5.4, or cause a breach of any of Customer’s agreements with any third parties or unreasonably interfere with other Saba customers’ use of Saba services. 5.2 Compliance with Laws and Regulations. Customer agrees (i) to use the Services only for lawful purposes and in accordance with this Agreement; (ii) to comply with all then-current export and import laws and regulations of the United States and such other governments as are applicable to any software, application services or Saba Technology that Customer may receive from Saba; and (iii) not to, directly or indirectly, export, re-export, or transship such software, application services or Saba Technology, or related information, media, or products in violation of any applicable laws and regulations. 5.3 Content. Customer acknowledges that Customer is responsible for all Content, and that Saba exercises no control whatsoever over the content of the information passing through Customer’s site(s), and that it is Customer’s sole responsibility to ensure that the information that Customer and Customer’s Users transmit and receive complies with all applicable laws and regulations, including without limitation all legal requirements regarding privacy, security, and the collection, use, transmission and retention of data within or between any jurisdiction(s). For the avoidance of doubt, Customer has the right to retrieve Customer’s Content at any time during any Subscription Term (or following termination of this Agreement, pursuant to the provisions of Section 10.3(a)). 5.4 Prohibited Activities. The Subscription Services are subject to the Acceptable Use Policy. Customer will not, and will not permit Customer’s Users to, engage in any activity prohibited by the Acceptable Use Policy (“Prohibited Activities”). If Customer becomes aware of any Prohibited Activities or breach of the Acceptable Use Policy, Customer will notify Saba and remedy the situation immediately, including, if necessary, limiting, suspending or terminating any relevant User’s access to the Subscription Services. In the event of a breach or suspected breach of the Acceptable Use Policy, Saba reserves the right to suspend Customer’s Services, if reasonably necessary to prevent harm to Saba, Customer, other customers, and\/or Saba’s partners, vendors and suppliers with such notice as may be reasonable in the context of the prospective harm. 5.5 Restricted Use. Except as expressly permitted on an order, Customer may not sell, rent or lease the Services provided hereunder to others, in any way whatsoever, including without limitation, using the Services for the purpose of operating a service bureau or application service provider, or other revenue generating activities. 6. Fee and Payment Terms. 6.1 Fees and Payment. Customer will pay to Saba the fees and charges set forth on the Orders. Except as otherwise expressly stated in an Order, all amounts are due within 30 days of Customer’s receipt of Saba’s invoice. Any payment by credit card requires Saba’s pre¬ approval and is payable upon signature of the Order. Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, all payments are non-refundable. 6.2 Late Payments. Any late payment will accrue interest at a rate of one and one-half percent (1 %%) per month, or the highest rate allowed by applicable law, whichever is lower. 6.3 Taxes. Customer will reimburse Saba for all sales, use, excise, and property taxes, value-added tax (VAT), goods and services tax (GST), or other taxes, levies, duties or withholdings Saba is required to collect or remit to applicable tax authorities (except for any taxes based on Saba’s net income). If Customer is required by any applicable law to deduct or withhold amounts otherwise payable to Saba hereunder, Customer will pay the required amount to the relevant governmental authority, provide Saba with an official receipt or certified copy or other documentation acceptable to Saba evidencing the payment, and pay to Saba, in addition to the payment to which Saba is otherwise entitled under this Agreement, such additional amount as is necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received by Saba free and clear of all taxes equals the full amount Saba would have received had no such deduction or withholding been required. 7. Limitations of Liability. 7.1 Consequential Damages Waiver. In no event shall either PARTY BE LIABLE OR RESPONSIBLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY TYPE OF INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOST REVENUE, LOST PROFITS, REPLACEMENT GOODS, LOSS OF TECHNOLOGY, RIGHTS OR SERVICES, LOSS OF DATA, OR INTERRUPTION OR LOSS OF USE OF SERVICE OR EQUIPMENT, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, WHETHER ARISING UNDER THEORY OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE. 7.2 Saba's entire liability to Customer whether in contract, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, RELATING TO THE SERVICES, ANY PRODUCT, OR THIS AGREEMENT, SHALL IN NO CIRCUMSTANCES EXCEED THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY CUSTOMER FOR THE SERVICES DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM. 8. Duty to Defend. 8.1 Saba shall defend or settle, at its expense, any claim or action (“Claim”) against Customer that (a) the Subscription Services, as made available by Saba to Customer under this Agreement and used within the scope of this Agreement, infringe any copyright, trade secret, patent or other proprietary right, or (b) is a result of personal injury September 2013 Saba Cloud SPC Confidential 3 caused by the negligence or willful misconduct of Saba; and Saba shall pay all final judgment awards against Customer or settlement costs in connection with such Claim. 8.2 Customer shall defend or settle, at Customer’s expense, any Claim brought against Saba that (a) any Content, as provided by Customer to Saba under this Agreement and used within the scope of this Agreement, infringes any copyright, trade secret, patent or other proprietary right, (b) is a result of personal injury or death caused by Customer’s negligence or willful misconduct, or (c) is a result of any violation of or failure to comply with Section 5; and Customer shall pay all final judgment awards against Saba or settlement costs in connection with such Claim. 8.3 Each party's obligations hereunder are contingent on the following conditions: i. The party entitled to a defense hereunder must notify the other party in writing promptly once the first party becomes aware of a Claim or the possibility thereof, grant the other party sole control of the settlement, compromise, negotiation, and defense of any such Claim, and provide the other party with all information related to the Claim that it may reasonably request; ii. The party obligated to provide a defense hereunder shall not be liable hereunder for any settlement made by the other party without advance written approval, nor for any award from any Claim in which the first party was not granted control of the defense; and iii. With respect to any Subscription Services that are found to be infringing, or in Saba’s opinion are likely to be found infringing, Saba may, at its option, (a) obtain the right for Customer to continue using the Subscription Services; (b) replace or modify the Subscription Services so they are no longer infringing but still provide substantially similar functionality, or (c) terminate the applicable Subscription Services. In the event of such termination, Saba will refund any subscription fees pre-paid by Customer for the terminated Subscription Services, pro-rated for the remainder of Customer’s Subscription Term after the effective date of termination. 8.4 The foregoing obligations of Saba shall not apply to any infringement Claim to the extent arising from (i) Customer’s use of the Services in a manner other than in accordance with this Agreement; (ii) Customer’s use of the Services in conjunction with Content or data where use with such Content or data gave rise to the infringement claim; and\/or (ii) Customer’s use of the Service(s) with other software, hardware or services, where use with such other software, hardware or services gave rise to the infringement Claim. The foregoing obligations of Saba shall constitute Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy for infringement or misappropriation claims and actions. 8.5 The parties agree to cooperate in good faith in the defense of any Claim that causes one party to invoke a duty to defend hereunder. 9. Confidentiality. Each party acknowledges that it will have access to certain confidential information of the other party concerning the other party's business, plans, customers, technology, and products, and other information held in confidence by the other party (“Confidential Information”). Confidential Information will include all information in tangible or intangible form that is marked or designated as confidential or that, under the circumstances of its disclosure, should be considered confidential. Confidential Information will also include, but not be limited to, the non-public portions of the Saba Technology, as well as the terms and conditions of this Agreement. A party receiving any Confidential Information (“Recipient”) from the other (“Discloser”) will use at least the same care to prevent disclosure and unauthorized use of such information as Recipient uses with respect to its own confidential and proprietary information of like importance under similar circumstances, which will not be less than reasonable care. Recipient will not disclose Confidential Information to any third parties, provided that Recipient may disclose the Confidential Information to its employees and contractors who need to know such information and who are bound in writing by restrictions regarding September 2013 Saba Cloud SPC 4 Confidential disclosure and use of such Confidential Information comparable to those set forth herein. Recipient will not use any Confidential Information for any purpose other than to exercise its rights and perform its obligations under this Agreement. The foregoing restrictions on disclosure and use will not apply with respect to any Confidential Information to the extent such Confidential Information: (a) was or becomes publicly known through no wrongful act or omission of Recipient; (b) was rightfully known by Recipient before receipt from Discloser; (c) is independently developed by Recipient (i.e., without the use of or reference to the Confidential Information of the Discloser); or (d) becomes rightfully known to Recipient without confidential or proprietary restriction from a source other than Discloser that does not owe a duty of confidentiality to Discloser with respect to such Confidential Information. Recipient may disclose Confidential Information to the extent Recipient is legally compelled to disclose such Confidential Information, provided, however, that prior to any such compelled disclosure, Recipient will give Discloser reasonable advance notice of any such disclosure and will cooperate with Discloser in protecting against any such disclosure and\/or obtaining a protective order narrowing the scope of such disclosure and\/or use of the Confidential Information. Saba may refer to Customer by name in Saba’s mandatory filings with securities authorities and regulatory bodies, and in associated communications with Saba’s investors. 10. Termination. 10.1 No Liability for Termination. Neither party will be liable to the other for any termination or expiration of any Services or this Agreement in accordance with its terms. 10.2 Termination for Cause. Either party may terminate this Agreement if the other party materially breaches this Agreement and does not cure such breach within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice of such breach from the non-breaching party. 10.3 Effect of Termination. Upon the effective date of termination of this Agreement: (a) Saba will immediately cease providing the Services. On Customer’s request, at any time during the thirty (30) day period following the effective date of termination, Saba will return all of Customer’s Content, in its native format (or in another format, if mutually agreed by Customer and Saba, which may require Customer to pay additional fees); and after the expiration of the foregoing thirty (30) day period, Saba may delete any Content; (b) any and all of Customer’s payment obligations under this Agreement for the Services provided through the effective date of termination will immediately become due; and (c) In the event of termination for cause by Customer pursuant to Section 10.2 or termination for Chronic Problems as provided in Section 4.2.4, Saba will refund any subscription fees pre-paid by Customer, pro-rated for the remainder of Customer’s Subscription Term after the effective date of termination. 10.4 Survival. The obligations of the parties under this Agreement, which by their nature would continue beyond termination, cancellation, or expiration of this Agreement, shall survive termination, cancellation, or expiration of this Agreement. 11. Miscellaneous Provisions. Governing Law. This Agreement is made under and will be governed by and construed in accordance with the applicable body of laws (except that body of law controlling conflicts of law), as follows: if this Agreement is entered into between Customer and Saba Software, Inc., the laws of the State of California will apply. If this Agreement is entered into between Customer and Saba Software (UK) Ltd., the laws of England and Wales will apply. To the extent not expressly prohibited by any applicable law, the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and all international and domestic legislative or other implementations of such Convention will not apply to this Agreement. Severability; Waiver. In the event any provision of this Agreement is held by a tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the law, the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. The waiver of any breach or default of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default, and will not act to amend or negate the rights of the waiving party. Publicity. Promptly after the Effective Date, the parties will cooperate reasonably to issue a mutually acceptable press release announcing Customer’s selection of Saba. Following go-live of the production environment of the Subscription Services ordered hereunder, Customer agrees that Saba may use Customer’s name in Saba’s customer lists, and, at Saba’s request (i) Customer agrees to be available as a customer reference for reference calls or onsite visits, and\/or to present at Saba public events, as approved by mutual agreement of the parties; and (ii) the parties will cooperate reasonably to prepare a mutually acceptable and approved “Success Story\/Case Study” about Customer’s use of Saba’s products and services, which may be used and made publicly available by Saba for marketing purposes. Assignment. Neither party may assign this Agreement either in whole or in part without the prior written consent of the other party, except that either party may assign this Agreement to a successor as the result of an acquisition, merger or other such change of control either in whole or in part of a party's business. Saba may also delegate the performance of certain Services to third parties, provided Saba controls the delivery of such Services to Customer and remains responsible to Customer for the delivery of such Services. This Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of each party's successors and permitted assigns. Notices. Any notice or communication permitted or required hereunder will be in writing and delivered in person or by courier, sent by confirmed facsimile (fax), or mailed by certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, and addressed as set forth on the Order or to such other address as given in accordance with this Section. If notice is given in person, by courier or by fax, it will be effective upon receipt; and if notice is given by mail, it will be effective five (5) business days after deposit in the mail. Any notice to Saba shall be copied at the same time in writing to: Saba Software, Inc. (Attn: Legal Department), 2400 Bridge Parkway, Redwood Shores, cA 94065, USA, Fax: +1 (650) 581-2647. Remedies. The parties agree in the event of a material breach of this Agreement, the non-breaching party will be entitled to seek immediate injunctive relief, in addition to whatever remedies it might have at law or under this Agreement. All rights and remedies hereunder are cumulative, may be exercised singularly or concurrently and will not be deemed exclusive except as expressly provided herein. If any legal action is brought to enforce any obligations hereunder, the prevailing party will be entitled to receive its attorneys’ fees, court costs and other collection expenses, in addition to any other relief it may receive. Force Majeure. Each party will be excused from performance for any period during which, and to the extent that, it is prevented from performing any obligation or service as a result of causes beyond its reasonable control, and without its fault or negligence, including acts of God, strikes, lockouts, riots, epidemics, acts of war, communication line failures and power failures. Audit. Saba may, from time to time and at its own expense, audit Customer’s usage of the Services to determine Customer’s compliance with the terms of each Order. Saba will promptly notify Customer if Customer’s usage of the Services exceeds Customer’s subscription entitlements. Customer agrees to pay for any additional subscriptions required for Customer’s actual usage. Government. If Customer is an agency or instrumentality of the United States Government, the software underlying the Subscription Services is “commercial computer software”, and pursuant to FAR 12.212 or DFARS 227.7202, and their successors, as applicable, use, reproduction and disclosure of the Software and Documentation are governed by the terms of this Agreement. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including any Order and all documents incorporated herein by reference, constitutes the complete and exclusive agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes and replaces any and all prior or contemporaneous discussions, negotiations, understandings and agreements, written and oral, regarding such subject matter. Customer acknowledges that any Orders made hereunder are not reliant, or contingent upon, the delivery, or promise of delivery, of any future functionality, features, products or services. The terms set forth in this Agreement and any Order will control in the event that there are any different or additional terms set forth on any purchase order or other form that Customer submits. This Agreement may not be modified or amended except in writing signed by a duly authorized representative of each party.

SERVICE AVAILABILITY GUARANTEE The Vendor will use all reasonable efforts to make RiskSense® available within its current operational environment within the AWS GovCloud (US) services with a Monthly Uptime Percentage (defined below) of at least 99.5%, in each SaaS deployment during any monthly billing cycle (the “Service Commitment”). In the event the Vendor does not meet the Service Commitment as described below, the CUSTOMER will be eligible to receive a Service Credit. SLA DEFINITIONS • “Monthly Uptime Percentage” is calculated by subtracting from 100% the percentage of minutes during the month in which RiskSense® was “Unavailable.” Monthly Uptime Percentage measurements will exclude downtime resulting from any “Predefined Maintenance Period.” o Less than 99.5% but equal to or greater than 95.0% 5% Service Credit o Less than 95.0% but equal to or greater than 90% 10% Service Credit o Less than 90% 15% Service Credit • “Unavailable” and “Outage” is defined as the Customer’s data within the RiskSense Platform as non-accessible. This means a Critical Priority (as defined by the EULA for RiskSense®) has occurred. The following conditions are excluded from the Outage definition: o Any issues on the CUSTOMER network that causes the users not to be able to access the platform, shall not be considered as an Outage o Any issues caused by factors outside of our reasonable control, including any force majeure event or Internet access or related problems beyond the demarcation point of the AWS GovCloud (US) environment. Con-08310 sarf_229438 16 FOR LEGAL USE ONLY CJK DocuSign Envelope ID: BE5C1D8E-3077-44DC-8729-290D2091EB8F • A “Service Credit” is a dollar credit, calculated as set forth below, that we may credit back to an eligible account. Service Credits are calculated as a percentage of the total monthly charges paid by you during the current billing cycle (excluding any one-time payments). o We will apply any Service Credits only against future RiskSense® payments otherwise due from the CUSTOMER. Service Credits will not entitle the CUSTOMER to any refund or other payment from the Vendor. A Service Credit will be applicable and issued only if the credit amount for the applicable monthly billing cycle is greater than one dollar ($1 USD). Service Credits may not be transferred or applied to any other account. Unless otherwise provided in the SaaS Agreement, the CUSTOMER’s sole and exclusive remedy for any unavailability, non-performance, or other failure by the HOST is the receipt of a Service Credit (if eligible) in accordance with the terms of this SLA. o To receive a Service Credit, CUSTOMER must submit a claim by opening a case in RiskSense® Support link within RiskSense. To be eligible, the credit request must be received by HOST by the end of the second billing cycle after which the incident occurred and must include the following: ■ the words “SLA Credit Request” in the subject line; ■ the dates and times of each Unavailability incident that you are claiming; ■ the CUSTOMER request logs that document the errors and corroborate your claimed outage (any confidential or sensitive information in these logs should be removed or replaced with asterisks). o If the Monthly Uptime Percentage of such request is confirmed by HOST and is less than the Service Commitment, then HOST will issue the Service Credit to CUSTOMER within one billing cycle following the month in which your request is confirmed by us. CUSTOMER’s failure to provide the request and other information as required above will disqualify CUSTOMER from receiving a Service Credit. o Please refer to the EULA for more information on the support process. • Any “Predefined Maintenance Period” is defined as: o Standard Weekly Maintenance - Every Friday evening from 9:00 PM MST to 11:00 PM MST. o Quarterly Maintenance - Once per quarter, the standard weekly maintenance may be extended to up to a maximum duration of 24 hours.

Effort covers the Channel Management Training Initiative for Integrated Payments. The consultant will come in and provide an assessment and suggest changes to the current Channel Management playbook. This is a 12 week engagement. Description of Product and\/or Service: Consulting Services Requestor and Vantiv Business Area: Alan Vitek, VP Sales Ops and Analytics and Sean Huston, Sr. Product Manager Term: 6\/15\/2015 - 8\/31\/2015 Auto-Renewing (Y\/N): No Pricing and Payment Schedule: Fixed Fee ($225,000), travel not to exceed 10% ($22,500) of total cost. Payment Schedule: 30% due upon SOW signature, 30% due by day 30, 30% due by day 60, 10% due 15 days following conclusion of project delivery. Vantiv Financial Commitment: $247,500.00 (Original proposal = $100k\/month for 4 months (or $400k), plus up to 15% in travel related expenses. Negotiated Savings by the LOB = $212,500. Vantiv Termination Rights: Yes, termination for convenience. Description of Non-Standard or Special Terms and Conditions (including standard Vantiv terms which were not agreed to by the supplier or materially modified): 1. Change in Control: In the event of a conflict between any terms of this SOW, the Addendum and\/or the Agreement, the terms of the Agreement will control, unless expressly stated in this SOW for the SOW to control. In such event, the SOW shall control only for the Services set forth herein and only for this engagement. This was inserted to address Termination for Convenience. SBI did not agree with Termination for Conveneince as written in the MSA and I wanted to ensure that Termination for Convenience was kept in as-is just in case the engagement does not work. As a middle ground the above language was inserted. Further, there is a payment schedule tied to Termination for Convenience in the SOW which is as follows: Either party may terminate this Statement of Work hereunder, in whole or in part, with or without cause upon 30 days' prior written notice to other party. If this Statement of Work is terminated without cause by Vantiv, in addition to compensating SBI through the 30 day notice period, Vantiv will also make a onetime termination payment equal to 50% of the remaining fees due under this SOW. 2.

Where applicable, the Supplier shall provide Worldpay with all Acceptance test results and permit Worldpay to be present during such testing. Once a Deliverable meets the Acceptance Criteria to Worldpay's satisfaction, Worldpay shall inform the Supplier of the same in writing (\"Acceptance”). Where all the relevant Deliverables for a Milestone are Accepted, the Supplier shall have achieved the relevant Milestone for such Deliverables as specified in the SOW. 3.7 Where applicable, the Parties agree that Delay Payments and Service Credits are intended to be a price adjustment to reflect the Supplier's failure to meet the applicable Milestone Dates, remedy a Fault or achieve a Service Level and that, accordingly, Delay Payments and Service Credits are without prejudice to any other remedy available to Worldpay whether under this Agreement, in law, in equity or otherwise. 3.8 The Supplier shall comply promptly with the lawful requests of Worldpay related to this Agreement, shall keep Worldpay regularly informed of progress in relation to the Services and Deliverables and shall attend meetings and discussions whenever reasonably requested by Worldpay. 3.9 The Supplier shall, except as otherwise expressly provided in an SOW, be responsible at its own cost for providing the facilities, Personnel and any other resources required to provide the Services. 3.10 Worldpay will provide such Worldpay Equipment and facilities to the Supplier as set out in the applicable SOW and the Supplier agrees in relation to the Worldpay Equipment: (a) it has no legal or equitable claim to the Worldpay Equipment and will not to contest ownership of it; SARF_278435 CON-11563 r°rL^.rlv DocuSign Envelope ID: 2C5F1C12-6AEE-4DE4-8AE7-26E1FA3FB524 (b) it shall not purport to pledge or in any way charge by way of security any Worldpay Equipment which shall at all times remain Worldpay's and\/or, if applicable, a third party lessor's property and shall waive any rights that may arise to take a lien over the Worldpay Equipment for any sums due to the Supplier pursuant to this Agreement and\/or any SOW; (c) it shall only use the same for the provision of the Services and, where the Worldpay Equipment consists of third party software, shall comply with the terms of such licences where these have been brought to its attention by Worldpay or the third party licensor; and (d) it shall be liable to Worldpay for any expenses, damages, claims and costs, including costs of repair, replacement and restoration arising out of or in connection with any damage (excluding fair wear and tear) or destruction to the Worldpay Equipment or facilities caused by the Supplier. 4. CONTRACT MANAGEMENT 4.1 Each Party will appoint a person responsible for the overall relationship with the other Party (\"Representative\"). 4.2 Unless such person is named as Key Personnel, the Supplier may replace its Representative at any time by written notice to Worldpay. Worldpay may replace its Representative at any time by written notice to the Supplier. 4.3 The Representatives will communicate with each other throughout the Term as necessary for the performance of the Agreement. 4.4 If Worldpay (acting reasonably) determines that a member of the Personnel should be removed from the provision of the Services, Worldpay will notify the Supplier in writing and the Supplier will immediately remove that person from the provision of the Services and will not permit that person to be involved subsequently in the provision of the Services without the prior written consent of Worldpay. 4.5 Without prejudice to its rights under clause 4.4 Worldpay may deny any of the Personnel access to any Group Company premises, systems and\/or data if it believes that the person concerned is not trustworthy or is otherwise unsuitable and may insist that the Supplier removes such person and replaces them with someone who is suitable. 4.6 For Key Personnel, the Supplier shall provide such individuals for the duration of the term of the relevant SOW unless prevented from doing so by circumstances outside the reasonable control of the Supplier. 4.7 The Supplier shall comply with Schedule 3 (Pre-Employment Screening) in relation to any of the Personnel who provide the Services from or at any of Worldpay's offices or other facilities or who have access to Worldpay systems. If any such Personnel do not meet Worldpay's background check requirements, Supplier shall not assign such employee or candidate to the Worldpay account or allow such employee or candidate access to Worldpay's Confidential Information or be used in the provision of the Services. 4.8 Failure by the Supplier to comply with the provisions of clauses 4.5 to 4.7 inclusive will be a material breach of this Agreement by the Supplier which Worldpay may elect to treat as not capable of remedy under clause 13.1(a). 5. CHARGES AND PAYMENT 5.1 In consideration for the performance of the Services, Worldpay shall pay to the Supplier the Charges as set out in an SOW; such Charges shall be exclusive of VAT or equivalent which (where applicable) shall be charged in addition. 5.2 Where the Services are to be paid for on a time and materials basis, the Supplier shall invoice Worldpay the Charges monthly in arrears unless detailed otherwise in an SOW. The Supplier shall provide the Personnel to Worldpay, for the relevant role or grade, at no higher than the rates set out in Schedule 1. 5.3 Where Milestones apply to the Services, the Supplier shall invoice Worldpay its Charges for the Services once a Milestone has been achieved. 5.4 Each invoice shall quote this Agreement, Worldpay's purchase order number, the date and\/or number of the relevant SOW, and contain such other information as Worldpay may reasonably require from time to time. Worldpay shall pay the Charges within sixty (60) days of receipt of a valid invoice. All Charges shall be calculated and payments made in pounds sterling unless otherwise agreed in an SOW. 5.5 Notwithstanding clause 5.4 above, Worldpay may reasonably withhold payment of Charges it disputes in good faith.

The Supplier shall indemnify Worldpay, its Group Companies, officers and\/or directors 8 against all Losses suffered or incurred by Worldpay, its Group Companies, officers and\/or directors arising out of or in connection with any claim that the Services and\/or Deliverables or any element of them infringe the Intellectual Property Rights of a third party. 8.5 The Supplier waives, and shall procure that all Personnel shall waive, any moral rights in the New IPRs (where applicable), to which it and\/or the Personnel is now or may at any future time be entitled, and agrees not to institute, support, maintain or permit any action or claim to the effect that any treatment, exploitation or use of such New IPRs and or other materials, infringes the Supplier's moral rights. 8.6 The Supplier shall, on the expiry or termination of the relevant SOW, where applicable, promptly deliver to Worldpay the source-codes of any Software that it has created, developed or modified in the course of providing the Services within ten (10) days of Worldpay's request to do so. 8.7 The Supplier hereby grants to Worldpay and its Group Companies a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, sub-licensable licence to access, use, modify and copy the Supplier's Pre-Existing IPRs solely for the purposes of receiving the Services and\/or using the Deliverables. 8.8 Worldpay hereby grants to the Supplier, for the term of the relevant SOW, a limited, non  exclusive, revocable, non-sub-licensable licence to use Worldpay's Pre-Existing IPRs and the New IPRs solely for the purposes of providing the Services. 8.9 The Supplier shall not include any third party material in the Deliverables without the prior written consent of Worldpay. To the extent that any of the Deliverables contain third party materials the Supplier shall: (a) disclose the existence of such materials to Worldpay; and (b) in consultation with Worldpay obtain such licences, assignments or other consents as are required, or Worldpay requests, to permit the use of such materials by Worldpay in order for Worldpay to enjoy the full benefit of its rights under this Agreement. Such terms shall not, unless Worldpay agrees, require Worldpay or the Supplier to release the New IPRs or part of them. 9. CONFIDENTIALITY 9.1 Each Party will, and each will procure that its personnel will keep confidential all Confidential Information of, or concerning, the other's Confidential Information received by it. 9.2 Clause 9.1 does not apply to information: (a) that is published or otherwise generally becomes available to the public, except as a result of a breach of this Agreement; (b) made available to a Party on a non-confidential basis; (c) to the extent required to be disclosed by any Law making body or Regulatory Authority, provided that the disclosing Party notifies the other, to the extent legally permissible, of the information to be disclosed as early as reasonably practicable before the disclosure and takes all reasonable action to avoid or limit the disclosure; (d) was developed independently by the receiving Party without access to, or use or knowledge of, the Confidential Information; or (e) that is already known by the receiving Party without any obligation of confidence. 9.3 Clause 9.1 will not restrict the sharing of any Confidential Information by the receiving Party to its personnel or professional advisors who need to know it to provide the Services and\/or to manage the relationship between the Parties, provided that such persons use it solely for such purpose and are under an obligation to the receiving Party to keep such information confidential. 9.4 Other than as expressly permitted under this Agreement, on termination of this Agreement for whatever reason, each Party will immediately: (a) cease to use any Confidential Information of the other and will return on written demand or, at the other's election, destroy or, so far as is reasonably practicable, permanently erase all copies of that Confidential Information in its possession or control; and (b) certify to the other Party within ten (10) Business Days of the date of termination that this has been done, save that a Party will be 9 permitted to retain such part of that Confidential Information only for the purposes of, and for so long as required by, any Law or its legitimate internal compliance requirements. 9.5 The Supplier shall indemnify Worldpay, its Group Companies, officers and\/or directors against all Losses suffered or incurred by Worldpay, its Group Companies, officers and\/or directors arising out of or in connection with the Supplier's breach of this clause 9. 9.6 The Parties each agree that damages may not be an adequate remedy for any breach of this Clause 9 and, notwithstanding clause 20 (Disputes), the disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek any legal and\/or equitable relief, including an injunction, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this clause 9 in addition to its other remedies under this Agreement or otherwise. 10. SAFEGUARDING DATA 10.1 If the Supplier has access to any Worldpay Data that is Personal Data then the provisions of Part A of Schedule 7 shall apply; if the Supplier has access to any Worldpay Data that is Cardholder Data or any environment storing or processing Cardholder Data, Part B of Schedule 7 shall apply. 11. INFORMATION SECURITY 11.1 Without limiting clause 9.1, the Supplier shall establish, implement and regularly maintain security, processes and plans (the “Supplier Security Plan”) which shall ensure the confidentiality and security of the Confidential Information, any Worldpay Data, and the Deliverables in accordance with Good Industry Practice and the requirements set out in Schedule 6. 11.2 The Supplier shall ensure that at all times it is operating in accordance with the terms of the Supplier Security Plan. 11.3 The Supplier will on Worldpay's request provide Worldpay or any third party acting on behalf of Worldpay with copies of the Supplier Security Plan and any other documentation relating to the Supplier's compliance with the Agreement's information security requirements and will explain how the Supplier Security Plan meets such information security requirements. 11.4 In the provision of the Services, the Supplier will adopt and use good development and coding practices in line with Good Industry Practice and adhere to any industry standards specified in the SOW. The Supplier will ensure that any application code or other materials developed for Worldpay are sufficiently tested and assured so as to ensure that common security flaws and vulnerabilities are not introduced into Worldpay's systems, products, services or websites. 11.5 The Supplier shall perform Security Tests of its systems (“Supplier Security Tests”) in a manner and frequency expected in accordance with Good Industry Practice to ensure the Supplier is operating in accordance with the Supplier Security Plan and will share the results of the Supplier Security Tests with Worldpay on request. The Supplier shall permit Worldpay or a security consultant selected and approved by Worldpay to carry out penetration tests on the Supplier's systems (“Worldpay Security Tests”). The Supplier shall provide Worldpay with all reasonable assistance to enable Worldpay to perform the Worldpay Security Tests. 11.6 If Worldpay considers (acting reasonably) that controls identified or tested in the performance of the Supplier Security Tests or the Worldpay Security Tests: (a) are insufficient to ensure the integrity and security of Worldpay's Confidential Information; or (b) fail to meet the requirements of any Regulatory Authority applicable to Worldpay; or (c) fail to meet industry standards relating to data or information security, then Worldpay may require the Supplier to remedy such insufficiency or failure and the Supplier (at its own cost) shall, as soon as is reasonably practicable, make those modifications. Where the additional measures affect the Supplier's subcontractors, suppliers and agents, the Supplier shall procure that those measures are implemented by the relevant subcontractors, suppliers and agents. 10 11.7 Upon any suspected or actual breach of any obligations or duties owed by the Supplier to Worldpay relating to information security or confidentiality, including any suspected or actual non-compliance with the Supplier Security Plan which affects the security and\/or confidentiality obligation of the Supplier, the Supplier will immediately remedy the breach and will promptly: (a) notify Worldpay of the breach and the Supplier's proposed remedial measures; (b) implement any actions or remedial measures at its own cost which Worldpay considers necessary as a result of the breach; and (c) provide Worldpay with evidence of the implementation of such remedial measures. 11.8 A breach of this clause 11 shall be a material breach which Worldpay may elect to treat as not capable of remedy for the purposes of this Agreement. 12. BRIBERY 12.1 The Supplier warrants and represents that it and its Personnel shall comply with any applicable Law in force from time to time and receive training at least annually regarding bribery, fraudulent acts and\/or any other corrupt practice. 12.2 If the Supplier, its Personnel or anyone acting on the Supplier's behalf (in all cases whether or not acting with the Supplier's knowledge) breaches this clause 12 Worldpay may terminate this Agreement by written notice with immediate effect. 12.3 The Supplier shall indemnify Worldpay, its Group Companies, officers and\/or directors against all Losses suffered or incurred by Worldpay, its Group Companies, officers and\/or directors arising out of or in connection with the Supplier's breach of this clause 12. 13. TERMINATION 13.1 Worldpay may (without prejudice to its other rights or remedies) terminate this Agreement and\/or an SOW with immediate effect by written notice to the Supplier if: (a) the Supplier commits a material breach of this Agreement or an SOW that is not remediable or, if remediable, is not remedied within fourteen (14) days after being given notice to do so; (b) the Supplier commits repeated or persistent breaches of the same or similar provisions of this Agreement and\/or any SOW (as applicable) which by their repetition become material; (c) a Force Majeure Event persists for ten (10) consecutive Business Days, or fourteen (14) days in any thirty (30) day period; (d) an Insolvency Event occurs in relation to the Supplier; or (e) a change of Control occurs in relation to the Supplier. 13.2 The Supplier may terminate this Agreement and\/or any relevant SOW immediately by notice in writing if Worldpay has failed to pay in full any undisputed amounts contained in an invoice from the Supplier within ninety (90) days of the due date of payment of such invoice provided that at least one written reminder notice has been delivered to Worldpay at least twenty- one (21) days prior to any such termination. 13.3 Each Party may terminate: (a) this Agreement for convenience at any time by giving thirty (30) days' prior notice in writing; and (b) any SOW for convenience at any time by giving ten (10) Business Days' prior notice in writing to the other party and this Agreement and\/or the relevant Statement of Work shall terminate at the expiry of such notice. 13.4 Upon termination or expiry of this Agreement or a relevant SOW the Supplier shall: (a) transfer all data, works-in-progress and Deliverables to Worldpay or its designated third party; 11 (b) subject to agreeing in advance the Charges (if any) payable, based on the charges set out in Schedule 1 and\/or an applicable SOW: 13.4. b.1 provide all co-operation to Worldpay or its designated third party to enable the migration and transfer of the provision of the Services to Worldpay or to its designated third party without interruption or disruption and to facilitate the orderly transfer of the Services; and 13.4. b.2 continue to provide the relevant Services for a period of no more than six (6) months after the relevant termination or expiry upon Worldpay's request. 13.5 If Worldpay terminates the Agreement or an SOW under clause 13.1(a) or 13.1(b), Worldpay shall not be obliged to pay any charges in connection with the Supplier's obligations set out in clause 13.4(b).2. 13.6 Upon termination of this Agreement all rights and obligations of any Party will cease to have effect immediately, save that the clauses and paragraphs which expressly or by implication have effect after termination will continue to be enforceable notwithstanding such termination (including clauses 5, 6, 7 through 12.3, 13, 14, 17, 19 to 21 and (as applicable) Schedules 6, 7 and 8); and termination will not affect accrued rights, obligations and liabilities of any Party under this Agreement as at the date of termination. 14. LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY 14.1 Nothing in this Agreement shall operate so as to exclude or limit the liability of either Party to the other for: (a) death or personal injury arising out of negligence or fraud; (b) any liability arising in connection with clauses 8.4, 9.5, 12.3, 17 and Schedule 7; (c) the consequences of any wilful default or abandonment of this Agreement (or any SOW, if applicable); or (d) any other liability which cannot be excluded or limited by law. 14.2 Subject to clause 14.1 and 14.4, the total aggregate liability of Worldpay to the Supplier under or in connection with this Agreement including liability for breach of contract, misrepresentation (whether tortious or statutory), tort (including, but not limited to, negligence), breach of statutory duty or otherwise, shall not exceed the total Charges paid to the Supplier under this Agreement. 14.3 Subject to clauses 14.1 and 14.4, the Supplier's total aggregate liability to Worldpay and the Group under or in connection with this Agreement including liability for breach of contract, misrepresentation (whether tortious or statutory), tort (including, but not limited to, negligence), breach of statutory duty or otherwise, shall not exceed the greater of 100% of the total Charges paid or payable under this Agreement and any SOW. 14.4 Save where specifically set out otherwise in this Agreement or an SOW, neither Party shall be liable, whether in tort (including for negligence or breach of statutory duty), contract, misrepresentation or otherwise for any special, indirect or consequential losses or damage (whether such losses or damage are foreseen, foreseeable, known or otherwise). 14.5 The Supplier shall maintain at its own cost insurance policies with a Reputable Insurance Company (means an insurance provider with a Standard & Poor's credit rating of at least AA- (or with an equivalent rating)) to cover potential liabilities which the Supplier may have to Worldpay under this Agreement or any SOW including: (a) (each in the amount of at least £10 million): Employers Liability, Professional Indemnity Liability\/Cyber and Data Breach insurance; and (b) Public Liability and Product Liability insurance in the amount of at least £5 million. Within seven (7) days of any request by Worldpay, the Supplier shall provide Worldpay with a copy of the insurance policies and any certificate from its insurers or insurance brokers confirming that the insurance is in force and that the current premiums 12 have been paid. 14.6 The Supplier shall maintain insurance policies which incorporate the automatic noting of interests of contracting parties without specific endorsement of named companies and which provide thirty (30) days prior written notice of any cancellation, non-renewal, or material amendment to be given to Worldpay, where any of the foregoing could materially reduce the amount and or scope of the insurances. The insurance policies referred to in clause 14.5 shall include: (a) an indemnity to principals clause providing for an indemnity to Worldpay as principal against legal liability in respect of which the Supplier would have been entitled to an indemnity under the insurance if the claim had been made against the Supplier provided that Worldpay as principal shall, be subject to the terms of the insurance in so far as they can apply; and (b) a clause waiving the insurer's subrogation rights against Worldpay, its employees and agents. 15. DISABLING DEVICES 15.1 The Supplier shall ensure that no Disabling Device is introduced into the Services, the Deliverables or Worldpay's information technology environment. 15.2 The Supplier shall immediately notify Worldpay upon the discovery of any such introduction of the Disabling Device and take all necessary remedial action to eliminate the Disabling Device from the affected item and mitigate any loss of operational efficiency or data. 16. BUSINESS CONTINUITY AND FORCE MAJEURE 16.1 The Supplier will ensure that at all times it has in place and is able to implement a business continuity and disaster recovery plan (\"BCDR Plan”) in accordance with its terms. If required, the Supplier will explain to Worldpay how the features set out in the BCDR Plan will interface with any business continuity and disaster recovery plans and procedures of Worldpay notified to the Supplier from time to time. 16.2 The Supplier shall develop, update, test and\/or exercise the BCDR Plan on a regular basis and, in any event, not less than once in every twelve (12) month period, in accordance with Good Industry Practice and if reasonably requested by Worldpay, the Supplier will engage an independent third party to test, audit and verify the Supplier's BCDR Plan at the Supplier's expense. 16.3 The Supplier shall, within thirty (30) days of any test of the BCDR Plan send to Worldpay a written report summarising the results of the test and shall promptly implement any actions or remedial measures which Worldpay considers necessary as a result of those tests. 16.4 The Supplier will permit Worldpay to have sight of the BCDR Plan upon reasonable notice at any time. If Worldpay considers (on reasonable grounds) that the BCDR Plan is insufficient to ensure the continued performance and operational resilience of the Services or fails to meet the requirements of any Regulator then Worldpay may require the Supplier to modify the BCDR Plan to cure such insufficiency or failure and the Supplier will promptly make the modifications that Worldpay require. 16.5 If a Force Majeure Event directly prevents a Party (the \"Affected Party”) from complying with any of its obligations under this Agreement and\/or any SOW (as applicable), the Affected Party may be excused from performance, and any liability for non-performance, of those obligations, for the duration of the Force Majeure Event, save that a Party is not entitled to rely on this clause 16.5 to the extent that it fails to take all reasonable steps to mitigate, avoid, circumvent, overcome and\/or minimise the period of the delay (including in the case of the Supplier, to implement the BCDR Plan) or to provide reasonable precautions or workarounds. The Affected Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to recommence performance or observance whenever and to whatever extent possible without 13 delay. 16.6 A Force Majeure Event shall not relieve the Supplier of its obligations to comply with the BCDR Plan, including requiring that essential Personnel report to work at a contingency location. 16.7 A breach of clause 16.1, 16.2, 16.3 and\/or 16.4 shall be a material breach which Worldpay may elect to treat as not capable of remedy for the purposes of this Agreement. 17. TUPE 17.1 The Supplier agrees to arrange Personnel in relation to the Services in such a way that no individual at any time (a) forms part of an organised grouping of employees which has as its principal purpose the provision of the Services or (b) no Personnel is\/are wholly or mainly assigned to the provision of the Services. 17.2 The parties agree and acknowledge that on the expiry of this Agreement, an SOW or at the cessation of any Services being provided by the Supplier (referred to as the \"End Date” for the purposes of this Agreement), the parties do not intend that any of the employees of either Party or their respective subcontractors will transfer to the other under the provisions of the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 (SI 2006\/246) as amended or replaced or any other regulations implementing the Acquired Rights Directive (\"TUPE”). 17.3 If any Personnel who were employed or otherwise engaged immediately prior to the End Date (\"Affected Employee”) should claim to be employed by Worldpay or a replacement supplier to Worldpay as a result of the provisions of TUPE applying in relation to this Agreement or an SOW then Worldpay shall, upon becoming aware of such claim, notify the Supplier in writing within fourteen (14) days and allow the Supplier the period of twenty eight (28) days from receipt of such notification either to offer employment to that person or take other steps with a view to obtaining a written withdrawal of that person's claim to be employed by Worldpay or a replacement supplier. 17.4 If the Affected Employee accepts employment with the Supplier, Worldpay shall immediately release that person from its employment or alleged employment. 17.5 The Supplier shall: (a) remain responsible throughout the period between the End Date and either the date of withdrawal of the Affected Employee's claim or the Supplier's release (per clause 17.4) for the payment of all salary and benefits to that person; and (b) indemnify Worldpay against all Employee Liabilities arising out of or in connection with non-payment of the same. 17.6 If the Affected Employee's claim that they are employed by Worldpay or a replacement supplier is not withdrawn or resolved within twenty eight (28) days of the Supplier being notified, Worldpay or the replacement supplier may terminate the Affected Employee's employment within fourteen (14) days of the twenty eight (28) Business Day period expiring. In such circumstances, the Supplier shall indemnify Worldpay against all Employee Liabilities arising out of or in connection with: (i) any claim or other legal recourse brought by the Affected Employee in respect of any fact or matter concerning or arising from their employment with the Supplier or its subcontractor and\/or their transfer to Worldpay or a replacement supplier; (ii) such person's salary and benefits; and (iii) the termination of the employment of such Affected Employee for whatever reason but excluding any Employee Liabilities arising out of or in connection with any claim of discrimination in respect of the act of termination itself by Worldpay or a replacement supplier, any failure on Worldpay's or a replacement supplier's part to follow any statutory minimum dismissal procedures or the payment by Worldpay or a replacement supplier of any ex gratia sum or settlement which is 14 not approved in writing in advance by the Supplier (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 17.7 In the event that TUPE applies to any Personnel, the Supplier shall indemnify Worldpay, its Group Companies, officers and\/or directors against all Losses suffered or incurred by Worldpay, its Group Companies, officers and\/or directors arising out of or in connection with Worldpay's compliance with TUPE or any failure by the Supplier, its subcontractors and\/or Personnel to comply with TUPE in relation to their employees and\/or the transfer of such employees. 17.8 Both parties shall comply with Regulation 13 of TUPE in so far as TUPE applies to that Party and shall share information with each other and any replacement suppliers to enable each Party to comply with the same. 17.9 Worldpay may in its absolute discretion assign the benefit of the indemnities contained in this clause 17 to a replacement supplier or replacement suppliers. 18. CHANGE CONTROL 18.1 A change to all or any part of the Agreement and\/or an SOW shall only be agreed in accordance with this clause 18. 18.2 Either Party may request in writing a change to the Services (“Change Request”) by notifying the other's Representative. 18.3 The Supplier Representative will, within ten (10) Business Days of receiving a Worldpay Change Request, explain to Worldpay's Representative in writing what impact implementing that Change Request would have upon the Charges, any delivery dates and (where appropriate) the Services (“Change Information”). 18.4 Worldpay will have fifteen (15) Business Days following receipt of the Change Information to accept or reject the proposed change to the Services. The Parties' Representatives shall agree the terms of the change in writing which, once signed by both Parties, shall constitute a change to this Agreement and\/or the relevant SOW. 18.5 Any change to an SOW made in accordance with this clause shall be made in the form of the template set out in Schedule 4, or such other form as the Parties agree. 19.

Legal notices to Worldpay must be copied to Worldpay's Head, Global Procurement at the above address. 19.7 No Notice of claim or termination by email - Neither Party may give notice to the other Party to terminate this Agreement or an SOW or to bring a claim in respect of this Agreement or SOW by email. 19.8 Waiver - No failure or delay on the part of either Party in enforcing against the other Party any term or condition of this Agreement will be construed as a waiver or release of that right or any other right or remedy, nor will any single or partial exercise of such rights preclude or restrict the further exercise of such rights. Any waiver by either Party of any of its rights under this Agreement must be in writing and signed by a duly authorised representative. 19.9 Counterparts - This Agreement may be executed and delivered in any number of counterparts, each of which is an original and which, together, have the same effect as if each Party had signed the same document. 19.10 Assignment - The Supplier shall not assign or sub-contract its obligations under this Agreement to any third party without the prior written consent of Worldpay.

GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION 21.1 This Agreement and any disputes or claims arising out of or in connection with it or its interpretation shall be governed by the laws of England and Wales. 21.2 The parties irrevocably agree that the courts of England and Wales have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim that arises out of or in connection with this Agreement, its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims).

The Supplier will appoint a qualified security assessor (\"QSA”) to verify its compliance with the PCI Standards as a Level 1 Service Provider, and obtain a PCI DSS Report on Compliance (\"ROC”). 5. The Supplier will provide evidence of its compliance with the PCI Standards annually and as Worldpay reasonably requests from time to time by: (a) providing Worldpay with an Attestation of Compliance (\"AOC”) signed both by the Supplier and the QSA and dated within the prior twelve (12) months; (b) providing Worldpay with a copy of the executive summary from the latest ROC from the QSA or a letter of attestation, describing the scope and services assessed by the QSA; and (c) providing to Worldpay in writing details of its procedures and policies relating to and implementing compliance with the PCI Standards. 6.

Digitally signed by Ruben H Castro A^rilO OmQ Date: 2018.04.02 14:46:16 -04130' ApillZ, ZU I O Signature Date Ruben H. Castro Procurement Manager Printed Name Title Page 1 of 11 Sponsorship Information Sponsorship: ___ Sponsorship DeteHs: LICENSE AGREEMENT: GENERAL TERMS & CONDITIONS 1. Management. Reed Exhibitions (a division of RELX Inc., a Massachusetts corporation) (“Management”) shall manage the event (the “Exhibition”) at the venue or venues (the “Venue”), both identified on the preceding page (“Page 1”). 2. Application Acceptance. If Management accepts the Application, Exhibitor shall receive a license (the “License”) to participate in the Exhibition as an exhibitor. The License permits Exhibitor to occupy and utilize the booth area or other space assigned to it by Management (the “Exhibit Space”) to exhibit permitted products at the Exhibition and to utilize, where applicable, Management provided services. Exhibitor acknowledges that its deposit shall be processed by Management upon receipt, but that such processing does not constitute an acceptance of the Application and does not grant Exhibitor a License. Exhibitor hereby acknowledges and represents to Management that Exhibitor has received and thoroughly read, understood and agrees with these General Terms & Conditions and Page 1. 3. License Agreement. The “License Agreement” includes: (i) these General Terms & Conditions, (ii) Page 1, Exhibitor Manual, (iii) any Management attachment hereto or thereto and any other terms incorporated by reference herein or therein (as each may be amended solely by a duly authorized representative of Management) including, without limitation, the Code of Conduct and IP Issues and Procedures (as amended from time to time), and (iii) the rules and regulations of the Venue. 4. Interpretation. Management shall, in its sole discretion, determine any dispute or conflict with respect to any matters not specifically covered by the License Agreement. Management shall have full power in the matter of interpretation, amendment and enforcement of the License Agreement. 5. Amendments. Amendments to the License Agreement by a duly authorized representative of Management shall be incorporated herein, and Exhibitor shall be subject to the provisions of the License Agreement as so amended when written notification is sent to Exhibitor (which may be communicated by e-mail). 6. Payment; Late Fees; Collection Fees. Exhibitor shall pay to Management all amounts due in accordance with Page 1. All fees due must be paid in full before Exhibitor shall be permitted to occupy the Exhibit Space. Failure to make payments pursuant to Page 1 shall subject exhibitor to a late fee on all past due balances owed to Management. Exhibitor shall pay any collection costs incurred by Management in collecting such balances owed, including, but not limited to, court costs, collection fees and attorney’s fees. 7. Cancellation, Withdrawal & Downsizing; Liquidated Damages. The parties agree that quantifying losses arising from Exhibitor’s cancellation, withdrawal or downsizing of the Exhibit Space is inherently difficult, as Management shall incur expenses, allocate resources and take other actions in connection with the tasks necessary to facilitate and manage the Exhibition. The parties further agree that the agreed upon sum is not a penalty, but rather a reasonable measure of damages based upon the parties’ experience in the exhibition industry and the nature of the losses that may result from such cancellation, withdrawal or downsizing of Exhibit Space. Exhibitor must provide written notice to Management for any cancellation, withdrawal or downsizing. The date Management receives such notice shall be the effective date of such cancellation, withdrawal or downsizing (the “Effective Date”). Any cancellation or withdrawal by Exhibitor entitles Management to the full amounts shown for Cancel\/Withdraw on Page 1. If, at the Effective Date, Exhibitor has already paid fees in an amount greater than the liquidated damages amount owed, Management shall refund the difference between the amount already paid and the liquidated damages amount to Exhibitor. If Exhibitor downsizes its originally agreed Exhibit Space requirements, it shall pay to Management (1) an amount equal to its revised financial obligation due for its decreased Exhibit Space requirements and (2) liquidated damages in the amount shown for Downsize on Page 1. 8. Advertisements. All advertisements in any media with signed insertion orders are non-cancelable and non-refundable. All advertisements are subject to Management approval. Management may, at its sole discretion, reallocate any advertisement space. Management may offer new advertisement products or positions throughout the Exhibition cycle that may not be listed on the License Agreement. 9. Booth Service Package. The booth service package, if any, is being provided as a service to Exhibitor. Any property that is purchased or leased in order to provide such service is merely incidental to the rendering of such service. Thus, the provider of such service shall remit all applicable sales and use taxes, which are invoiced by such provider and collected by Management from Exhibitors and remitted to the provider, on such property when purchased or leased. 10. Set-off. Management shall have the right to set-off against any amount which may be due from Management to Exhibitor, pursuant to the License Agreement or otherwise, any amounts owed to Management or its affiliates by Exhibitor or its affiliates for any reason. Management shall also have the right to apply any amounts received from Exhibitor under the License Agreement to any other amounts due to Management or its affiliates from Exhibitor or its affiliates. 11. Eligible Exhibits. Exhibitor shall exhibit materials, products or services directly related to the Exhibition’s industries and of specific interest to attendees. Management reserves the right to determine the eligibility of any product for display. Only Exhibitor’s name or logo may appear on signage placed on the Exhibit Space and in the Exhibition exhibitor list. No exhibits or advertising shall be allowed to extend beyond or above the back and side rails of the Exhibit Space, without Management’s prior written consent. Exhibits for the purpose of soliciting prospective employees, and employee-recruiting activity of any kind, are prohibited, without Management’s prior written consent. Only Exhibitor’s products may be displayed in the Exhibit Space. Exhibits must be used solely for the purpose of promoting Exhibitor’s products and\/or services and shall not be used for other business purposes. Exhibitor shall not use the Exhibit Space to promote any other exhibition or conference without Management’s prior written consent. Management rulings with regard to any Exhibit Space use are final. Exhibitor’s exhibit shall be admitted and permitted to remain solely by strict compliance by Exhibitor with the License Agreement. Management reserves the right to reject, eject or prohibit any exhibit, in whole or in part, Exhibitor or any of its representatives, upon Management’s good faith determination that the same is not in accordance with the License Agreement. Management shall provide no refunds in the event of such rejection, ejection or prohibition. Only a brand’s owner or legal U.S. distributor may exhibit such brand at the Exhibition. Exhibitor must list its participating principals as the exhibitors-of-record. Management reserves the right to verify the identity and status of the brand’s owner and the legal U.S. distributor. In the event of a conflict between a brand’s owner and U.S. distributor, the brand’s owner shall have the sole right to exhibit such brand at the Exhibition. Page 3 of 11 In connection with any IP issues between exhibitors, the “Addendum - IP Issues and Procedures” in the Exhibitor Manual shall apply. 12. Permitted Publications. Management reserves the right to determine the eligibility of any publication for display or distribution. Publications which contain advertisements purchased by exhibitors and which (a) are published only during the Exhibition or (b) otherwise target the Exhibition and its customers are not eligible products for display or distribution from any exhibit space or from anywhere in the Venue or its grounds. For the avoidance of doubt, non-official show dailies are not eligible products for display or distribution. Exhibitor shall not exhibit, offer for sale, give as a premium, hand out, distribute or advertise articles or publications not manufactured or sold in its own name. 13. Intellectual Property. Management expects Exhibitor to respect the intellectual property rights of other parties. Exhibitor shall not market, sell or display any product at the Exhibition that is counterfeit or in any way infringes trademarks, copyrights, patents or other intellectual property of a third party. Exhibitor warrants that the names, logos, art work and other content Exhibitor or its agents submitted for use in any media (including, but not limited to, ads, the Exhibition website or any Exhibition publication) shall not infringe the intellectual property rights of any third party and shall not contain anything which is libelous, obscene, indecent, blasphemous or in any way unlawful. Any exhibitor determined to be involved in unauthorized, counterfeit or infringing activity, will be subject to having all such unauthorized, infringing, counterfeit or misleading products removed from the Exhibition or the exhibitor being removed from current and future Exhibitions. However, this stipulation does not create an obligation for Management to take such action. Management does not accept liability for intellectual property infringements that may be committed by the Exhibitor. 14. Intellectual Property Disputes Between Exhibitors; Service of Process & Orders. Neither Exhibitor nor its agents (including, but not limited to, legal counsel or process servers) shall serve process on any other exhibitor during the hours the Exhibition is open to attendees. If Exhibitor has obtained a judicial\/administrative relief order against another exhibitor, and Exhibitor has no reasonable alternative to serving such order on the other exhibitor during the Exhibition, then Exhibitor or its agent shall use their best efforts to serve such order during the hours the Exhibition is closed to attendees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Exhibitor shall provide Management advanced written notice of the order obtained (including a copy of such order) so that a Management representative may escort Exhibitor or its agent to the booth of the exhibitor to be served and minimize any disruption to the Exhibition caused by such service. Exhibitor agrees to use its best efforts to resolve any intellectual property disputes with other exhibitors by no later than one week prior to the Exhibition’s first move-in day for Exhibitors and in a location other than the Venue. 15. No Sub-Licensing. Exhibitor shall not sub-license, assign or transfer the Exhibit Space. Exhibitor shall not permit any person other than Exhibitor to occupy or conduct business in Exhibit Space, or any part thereof, without Management’s prior written consent. Upon discovery of a booth share violation, Management may impose penalties on Exhibitor. 16. No Assignment. This License Agreement (and License granted hereunder) is non-assignable by Exhibitor. Any attempted assignment of the License Agreement or License by Exhibitor shall be null and void and shall constitute a breach, resulting in termination of the License Agreement and cancellation of the License. Management may assign the License Agreement at any time to its affiliate or any owner\/purchaser of the Exhibition, by operation of law or otherwise. 17. Custom Booths. If Exhibitor shall use a custom booth in the Exhibit Space, it shall provide Management promptly upon request (and no later than 30 days prior to the Exhibition) detailed constructions drawings showing all dimensions and orientation of such custom booth. 18. Exhibitor Conduct. Retail sales are prohibited during the Exhibition and entitle Management to shut down the Exhibit Space and remove Exhibitor from the Venue. Subject to the foregoing, Exhibitor may distribute samples, souvenirs, permitted publications and similar items, or conduct other sales or sales promotion activities only from within the Exhibit Space. Management retains sole discretion to approve, control or prohibit which samples and other items may be distributed and where such samples may be distributed. Any Exhibitor demonstration, distribution or activity that results in obstruction of aisles or prevents ready access to other exhibitors’ booths is prohibited and shall be suspended permanently or for any periods specified by Management. 19. Compliance with Laws. Exhibitor shall comply with all U.S. Federal, State and local laws and shall obtain all required permissions under such laws and from the Venue, including the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended. 20. Union Work Rules. Exhibitor shall abide by union work rules and jurisdictions of the city and Venue, if applicable, including the Venue’s exclusive services. 21. Good Neighbor Policy. Exhibitor shall operate the Exhibit Space so as not to annoy, endanger or interfere with the rights of other exhibitors or attendees. Management may, in its sole discretion, prohibit any action resulting in complaints from other exhibitors or attendees and which interferes with the rights of others or exposes them to annoyance or danger. Exhibitor’s unreasonable interference with or inconvenience to the Exhibition, exhibitors or attendees shall be deemed a breach of the License Agreement. 22. Exhibitor Representatives; Exhibit Space. Exhibitor representatives shall be restricted to Exhibitor’s employees and authorized representatives and must be 18 years of age or older, unless Management provides prior written consent. Management may, in its sole discretion, limit the number of Exhibitor’s representatives in the Exhibit Space. Exhibitor’s representatives shall at all times wear badge identification furnished by Management. Exhibitor acknowledges that it shall require its representatives to dress and conduct themselves in an appropriate and professional manner. Management reserves the right to determine, in its sole discretion, whether the character and attire of Exhibitor’s representatives is acceptable. Exhibitor representatives must staff the Exhibit Space during all hours the Exhibition is open. Management may use tents and\/or temporary exhibition facilities, as it deems necessary in its sole discretion. 23. Default in Occupancy. The actual occupancy by Exhibitor of the Exhibit Space is a material obligation of Exhibitor and is of the essence of the License Agreement. If the Exhibit Space is not occupied by the time set for completion of installation of displays, the Exhibit Space may be re-possessed by Management for any purpose it may see fit without in any way releasing Exhibitor from any liability hereunder. 24. Safety and Fire Laws; Electrical Safety; No Smoking. Exhibitor must strictly observe all applicable fire and safety laws and regulations. Drapes and all other cloth decorations must be flameproof. Wiring must comply with local fire department, governmental agency fire inspection ordinances and underwriters’ rules. Smoking (including electronic cigarettes) in the Venue is Page 4 of 11 forbidden. Crowding shall be restricted, and aisles and fire exits must not be blocked at any time. Products for display, signage, banners and decorations must not violate applicable fire codes. No storage behind exhibits is provided or permitted. Display wiring must exhibit all applicable seals of official approving agencies as may be required by the Venue. All displays must meet the building codes of the city in which the Exhibition takes place. 25. Exhibitor Breach. If Exhibitor breaches any of its obligations under the License Agreement, (1) Management may immediately, without notice, prohibit Exhibitor from exhibiting at the Exhibition and all future shows and exhibitions run by Management and terminate the License hereunder, (2) Management shall retain all amounts paid hereunder and Exhibitor shall pay Management any remaining balance outstanding according to Page 1 and (3) Management may pursue any other legal or equitable remedies to which it is entitled. Further, Management may thereupon direct Exhibitor to immediately remove its employees, any of its representatives and agents, its merchandise and other property from the Venue. 26. Resolution of Certain Disputes. If there is a dispute or disagreement between (1) Exhibitor and an official contractor, (2) Exhibitor and a labor union or labor union representative or (3) Exhibitor and one or more exhibitors, Management’s interpretations of the rules governing the Exhibition and its actions or decisions concerning the dispute or disagreement and its resolution shall be binding on Exhibitor. 27. Exhibitor Directory, Exhibition Website & Exhibition Publications. Exhibitor authorizes Management to publish Exhibitor’s directory entry on the Exhibition website, in the official catalogue for the Exhibition and in any other directory relating to the Exhibition or relevant industry. Exhibitor is required to complete its own directory entry on the Exhibition website. If Exhibitor fails to complete its directory entry on the Exhibition website, Management shall be entitled to enter Exhibitor’s details from Page 1 and an exhibit description from a previous Exhibition year (if available) on its behalf. Management shall not be liable for any omissions, misquotations or other errors, including, without limitation, any which appear in the Exhibition directory, on the Exhibition website, in the official catalogue of the Exhibition or any other media. 28. Publicity & Promotion; Permissions. Exhibitor gives Management the permission to use Exhibitor’s name, logo and products and the likeness of any person or products exhibited in all media formats (whether now known or hereafter existing) in connection with the promotion and publicity of the Exhibition. Exhibitor waives the right to inspect or approve the finished product. Exhibitor also waives all rights to royalties or other compensation arising out of or related to use of Exhibitor’s name, logo and products and the likeness of any Exhibitor personnel in such advertising media. 29. Photography. The photographic rights for the Exhibition are reserved to Management, but Exhibitor may request photography services from the official photographers, if desired. All other photography is strictly prohibited without Management’s prior written consent in advance of the Exhibition. Photographing other exhibitors’ booths or products is strictly prohibited, and such violations may result in ejection from the Exhibition and\/or confiscation of camera equipment. 30. Damage to Property. Exhibitor is liable for any damage it or its agents cause to the Venue’s floors, ceilings, walls or columns, or to standard booth equipment, or to other exhibitors’ property. 31. Indemnity. Exhibitor shall indemnify and hold harmless Management, the Exhibition’s owner(s) and sponsors, the Venue owner, and the city in which the Exhibition is being held if the city owns the Venue, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees and other agents, from and against all claims, losses, suits, damages, judgments, expenses, costs (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees) and charges of every kind arising out of or resulting from (1) its execution of the License Agreement or its occupancy of the Exhibit Space or presence at the Exhibition, (2) the actions, inactions or negligence of Exhibitor, its agents, representatives or employees (including Exhibitor appointed contractors), (3) the breach by Exhibitor of the intellectual property rights of any third party, whether knowingly or unknowingly, and whether intentionally or unintentionally (including, but not limited to, the sale or distribution of pirated goods and counterfeits\/”knock-offs” of existing products and services), (4) Exhibitor’s submissions to Management related but not limited to ads, Exhibitor director, the Exhibition website and Exhibition publications (5) Exhibitor’s allegations of infringement against another exhibitor, including Exhibitor’s service of process on another exhibitor, (6) Exhibitor’s service of a judicial\/administrative order on another exhibitor, (7) Exhibitor’s use of music, (8) Exhibitor’s violations of any legal and\/or regulatory requirements or (9) actions taken by Management at: (i) the request of an exhibitor regarding the asserted IP rights of that exhibitor; or (ii) the discretion of Management where Management had a reasonable belief as to the legitimacy of its action in regard to the asserted Intellectual Property rights of an exhibitor. 32. Limitation of Liability. Management shall not be responsible for and shall have no liability resulting from loss or damage to displays or goods belonging to Exhibitor, whether resulting from, without limitation, fire, storms, acts of God, air conditioning or heating failure, theft, pilferage, disappearance, bomb threats, roof leaks, Exhibitor booth visitors and guests, shipments coming in or out of the Venue or Exhibit Space, inadequately packed property or other causes. All such items are brought to the Exhibition and displayed at Exhibitor’s own risk, and should be safeguarded at all times. If Exhibitor’s products to be exhibited and\/or display materials fail to arrive, Exhibitor is nevertheless responsible for License fees. Management shall provide the services of a protective agency during the period of installation, show and dismantling, and Exhibitor agrees that the provision of such services constitutes adequate discharge of all obligations of Management to supervise and protect Exhibitor’s property within the Exhibition. Exhibitor may furnish additional guards at its own cost and expense only with the prior written consent of Management. Management makes no representations or warranties with respect to the number of attendees or the demographic nature of such attendees. 33. Due Execution. If the individual holding herself\/himself out as duly authorized to execute the License Agreement is not so authorized, he or she hereby covenants to indemnify Management (and its affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees and other agents) from and against all claims, losses, suits, damages, judgments, expenses, costs (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees) and charges of every kind caused by her\/his execution of the License Agreement and (without limitation) shall be personally liable to Management for all payments that would have been payable to Management by Exhibitor had the License Agreement been duly executed on behalf of Exhibitor. 34.

Such CGL insurance shall name as additional insureds RELX Inc. and their affiliates, the Venue owner, the city in which the Exhibition is being held if the city owns the Venue and any additional party Management may reasonably request. Exhibitor shall also maintain at its sole cost Page 5 of 11 and expense Workers Compensation insurance in an amount compliant with at least the statutory minimum, for employees participating in the Exhibition, as required by law. Exhibitor’s failure to comply with the insurance requirements in this Section shall not relieve Exhibitor of its indemnification obligations pursuant to Section 31 above. Exhibitor understands that neither Management nor the Venue maintains insurance covering Exhibitor’s property, and it is the sole responsibility of Exhibitor to obtain such insurance. Exhibitor must maintain property insurance covering Exhibitor’s property on an \"all risk” basis at all times, including, without limitation, when (as applicable) property is stored in vaults on the Exhibition floor. Certificates of Insurance must be available onsite during the Exhibition and must be furnished by Exhibitor if requested by Management. 35. Non-Force Majeure Changes to Dates, Venue or Exhibit Space by Management. Management may, in its sole discretion, change the dates and\/or Venue for the Exhibition upon written notice to Exhibitor (which may be communicated by e-mail).

Additionally, Management reserves the right to relocate Exhibitor to any exhibit space within the Venue at any time. Management may retain any portion of Exhibitor’s License fee paid pursuant to Page 1 and such amount shall be applied as though no change in date, Venue or Exhibit Space relocation had occurred. Any remaining payments due from Exhibitor shall be due in accordance with Page 1.

(c) Non-Force Majeure Cancellation. All obligations hereunder with respect to a Show shall automatically terminate if, for any reason whatsoever, RX cancels such Show.

(“Savana”). For purposes of this Agreement, FIS and its employees, agents and affiliates shall be referred to as the \"Disclosing Party\" and Savana and its employees, agents and affiliates shall be referred to as the \"Receiving Party,” except as set forth in Section 4.6. 1. Introduction. Resources of Savana require access to systems running out of an FIS data center for the purposes of supporting Savana’s Loan Origination System (LOS) application that is operated by FIS for the benefit of State Farm Bank, fob (“SFB”). Support includes installation of Savana software, configuring web sites and IIS settings, troubleshooting production issues and day to day maintenance of the LOS system (the \"Purpose\"). FIS is willing to permit such access pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. 2. INFORMATION SECURITY. Access to the LOS system is granted via LC accounts and Savana may only log in to the LOS system via FiS VPN and\/or FIS issued laptops. In the event Savana personnel will receive access credentials for FIS's facilities, applications, systems or servers, those of its affiliates or those of any clients or any of their customers, the following provisions will apply. 2.1 Savana will require all Savana personnel that will be issued access credentials to submit to FIS's then current access credentialing process, which may include, but is not limited to a background check by FIS or its third party provider pursuant to Section 3.1 of this Agreement. 2.2 Savana will promptly, but in any event within twenty-four (24) hours, (i) confiscate each such access credential from Savana personnel when the Savana personnel's need to have such access in order for the services to be performed is discontinued and (ii) notify FIS of any change in the status (including any such suspension, termination or discontinuation) of Savana personnel for whom such a device or access credential has been requested or to whom such a device or access credential has been provided. 2.3 Savana will not request that an access credential be provided, or provide an access credential, to any individual who will not be directly engaged by Savana for the Purpose. 2.4 FIS reserves the right to deny any access credential request or terminate any access credential that has been provided. Savana will notify FIS within twenty-four (24) hours of any changes in the status (including any such suspension, termination or discontinuation) of the Savana personnel for whom an access credential has been requested or to whom an access credential has been provided. 2.5 Savana will not permit any such access credential to be used by more than one individual. Service Agreement with SFB (“MSaaS”) to which FIS is not a party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, this Agreement shall not in any way apply to or modify any rights or obligations of Savana or SFB under the MSaaS. Savana’s access to systems running out of an FIS's data center for the Purpose, as between FIS and Savana, shall be governed solely by this Agreement. 3.1 Savana will ensure that its employees who have access to the facilities, network, records or data of FIS pursuant to this Agreement shall authorize FIS to perform, at FIS's expense, a background check on such employees, as described herein. Where permitted by applicable law, the background check will consist of, at a minimum, verification of the highest level of education completed, verification of employment for the past ten (10) years, social security number trace and validation, and a check of U.S. Government Specially Designated National (OFAC) and export denial lists. In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the background check will include a 9-panel drug test and criminal record search. For the drug test, all specimens will be tested at a Department of Health and Human Services\/Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration certified lab, and the screening service will include confirmation of all positive test results. The criminal record search will include, to the maximum extent permitted by Law, a federal, state and county check, and a National Criminal File check, for felony and misdemeanor convictions for the last ten (10) years in all locations where the individual has resided for the last ten (10) years. FIS will comply with all applicable laws related to the background check, including required notices and applicable consents. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Savana will require the individual to report to Savana any criminal convictions. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Savana will not assign anyone to receive access to the FIS data center under this Agreement who has tested positive for drugs or whose background check findings do not meet the standards established by FIS in accordance with all applicable laws, including if there is a conviction or referral to a pretrial diversion program for a crime that is related to his or her duties. Savana acknowledges that under the banking laws, an individual may not participate, directly or indirectly, in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of any insured depository institution without regulatory consent if he or she has a conviction, or has agreed to enter into a pretrial diversion or similar program in connection with a prosecution, of a crime involving dishonesty, breach of trust or money laundering, including any crime concerning the illegal manufacture, sale, distribution of or trafficking in controlled substances, unless the crime meets certain criteria for treating the crime as de minimis. The background check must be completed by FIS before assignment of an individual and periodically thereafter. FIS will keep each individual's information from the background checks confidential, will only use such information for the purpose set forth in this Section 3.1, and will not disclose such information without the individual's written consent unless otherwise required under applicable law. 3. Savana does not require, will not have access to, and will not store any data of FIS in connection with this Agreement or the Purpose. Savana may in connection with the Purpose have access to SFB data which such Purpose and access are not governed by this Agreement and, as between SFB and Savana, shall be governed solely by Savana’s Master Software as a 3.2 Savana will have an independent third party annually prepare, and will make available to FIS, portions of a Type II SOC 2 report as set forth below concerning its operations, systems, controls and procedures, in accordance with Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) No. 16 and, at FIS's written request, will electronically transmit to FIS a copy of such portions of Savana's latest SOC 2 report that are related to the access provided by FIS under this Agreement. All SOC 2 FIS reports and portions thereof shall constitute the Confidential Information of Savana. 4.

The Receiving Party may reveal Confidential Information only to employees who: (i) need to know the Confidential Information for the Purpose; and (ii) have been informed of and agreed to abide by the terms of this Agreement. 4.3 Nothing herein shall constitute a commitment to the development or release of any future products or the entry into any form of business relationship or be construed as granting any right or license under any copyright, patent, trademark or any other intellectual property right, now or hereafter owned or controlled by the Disclosing Party. 4.4 All Confidential Information, including any materials based thereon and any copies thereof shall be returned to the Disclosing Party upon the first to occur of (i) completion of the Purpose; (ii) termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 5.2 hereof; or (iii) request by the Disclosing Party. The requirements of confidentiality set forth herein shall survive the return or destruction of such Confidential Information. 4.5 In the event that the Receiving Party or any third party becomes legally compelled to disclose any of the Confidential Information, the Receiving Party shall promptly notify the Disclosing Party to enable the Disclosing Party to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, the Receiving Party shall furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information that is legally required and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such Confidential Information. 4.6 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all reports and information related to the SOC 2 reports disclosed under Section 3.2 of this Agreement shall constitute confidential information of Savana (“Savana Confidential Information”).

This Agreement cannot be amended or modified except by written agreement of signed by an authorized representative of each party. The failure of either party to act upon any right, remedy, or breach of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of that or any other right, remedy, or breach.

All persons involved in the message solving process can access the status of the message at any time. In exceptional cases, Licensee may also contact SAP by telephone. For such contact (and as otherwise provided) SAP requires that License provide remote access as specified in Section 3.2(iii). SAP Enterprise Support is provided exclusively to Licensee's Customer Center of Expertise.

If, after reviewing such test results, FIS believes that additional testing is warranted, Provider will discuss such additional testing with FIS in good faith. (4) Provider will notify FIS of any and all breaches to Provider’s information security and work with FIS management to identify the root cause of the incident and the potential impact to FIS, its Clients or their customers, as reasonably requested by FIS. (5) Not more frequently than once each quarter during the Term, and thereafter for so long as Provider continues to provide the Service, Provider will conduct, or have a third-party conduct, vulnerability scans and penetration tests of those components of Provider’s environment required to support the Service and will promptly, and in any event not less than ten (10) business days following receipt from such third party, provide to FIS the results of any such scans and tests. In addition, Provider will allow FIS or one of FIS’s approved third-party security assurance vendors to perform periodic vulnerability scans and penetration tests of those components of Provider’s environment, if any, required to support any Product. FIS agrees to share the results of any scan or test it performs in Provider’s environment to assist Provider in correcting any information security vulnerabilities identified. Provider will correct _any information security vulnerability identified in FIS’s or Provider’s own scans and Procurement Contract Supplement Page 2 Ver. 02-03-2015 penetration tests within the applicable time periods below, based on the severity level of the vulnerability, and provide FIS a new scan report upon remediation: (a) High (CVSS great than 7) severity vulnerabilities will be corrected within thirty (30) business days; (b) Medium to Low (CVSS less than 7) severity vulnerabilities will be corrected within ninety (90) business days; Provider will be considered to have access to such data in the event that a communications link (defined as a pre¬ established communications path from the customer premises, through a carrier network, to a network of FIS, its Clients or their customers) exists between any of Provider’s systems or servers and any systems or servers on which such data is stored. d. BACKGROUND CHECKS. Provider will ensure that a background check, as described herein, has been completed for each individual who is performing any Services under the Agreement and has access to the facilities, records or data of FIS, any Affiliate, any Client or any customer of a Client. Where permitted by applicable Law, the background check will consist of, at a minimum, verification of the highest level of education completed, verification of employment for the past ten (10) years, social security number trace and validation, and a check of U.S. Government Specially Designated National (OFAC) and export denial lists. In addition, to the extent permitted by Law, the background check will include a 9-panel drug test and criminal record search. For the drug test, all specimens will be tested at a Department of Health and Human Services\/Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration certified lab, and the screening service will include confirmation of all positive test results. The criminal record search will include, to the maximum extent permitted by Law, a federal, state and county check, and a National Criminal File check, for felony and misdemeanor convictions for the last ten (10) years in all locations where the individual has resided for the last ten (10) years. Provider will comply with all applicable Laws related to the background check, including required notices and applicable consents. In addition, Provider will require the individual to report any criminal convictions. Provider will not assign anyone to perform Services for FIS who has tested positive for drugs or whose background check findings do not meet the standards established by Provider in accordance with all applicable Laws, including if there is a conviction or referral to a pretrial diversion program for a crime that is related to his or her duties. Provider acknowledges that under the banking Laws, an individual may not participate, directly or indirectly, in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of any insured depository institution without regulatory consent if he or she has a conviction, or has agreed to enter into a pretrial diversion or similar program in connection with a prosecution, of a crime involving dishonesty, breach of trust or money laundering, including any crime concerning the illegal manufacture, sale, distribution of or trafficking in controlled substances, unless the crime meets certain criteria for treating the crime as de minimis. The background check must be completed before assignment of an individual and periodically thereafter. e.

(2) In providing any notice of a Breach, Provider will use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) provide notice to one or more FIS managers generally responsible for security matters relating to the FIS Confidential Information affected by the Breach, within twenty-four (24) hours of discovering the Breach, and (ii) keep FIS informed as to the actual and anticipated effects of the Breach and the corrective actions taken or to be taken in response to the Breach. In addition, if the Breach results or is likely to result in misuse of NPI, PHI or payment card data, Provider will (A) notify FIS as soon as possible and reasonably cooperate with FIS in its efforts to notify affected Clients and their customers and to mitigate the actual or potential harm resulting from the Breach and (B) reimburse FIS for its reasonable costs in notifying Clients or their customers of the Breach and making available to them any credit monitoring services and for any other costs FIS reasonably incurs with respect to the Breach. (3) FIS Confidential Information will remain the property of FIS, its Affiliate or other party from or through whom it was provided. (4) Except for NPI, PHI, other information protected by the Privacy Regulations, or any payment card data, (a) the parties’ respective confidentiality obligations under the Agreement do not apply to any information that: (i) was previously known by the party; (ii) is a matter of public knowledge; (iii) was or is independently developed by the party; (iv) is released for disclosure with written consent of the party; or (v) is received from a third party to whom it was disclosed without restriction. (b) each party may disclose information notwithstanding its confidentiality obligations under the Agreement to the extent required (i) by Law, (ii) in connection with the tax treatment or tax structure of the Agreement; or (iii) in response to a valid order of a U.S. court or other governmental body, provided that the party provides the other party with written notice and the other party is afforded a reasonable opportunity to obtain a protective order with respect to the disclosure.

In connection with services you are providing to Fidelity Information Services, LLC or one or more of its affiliates (FIS and all of such affiliates being referred to as “FIS”) under the Agreement, you receive or may receive NPI and other information of a proprietary nature, which may include cardholder data protected by the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (FIS Confidential Information”). By signing and returning this Amendment, you agree: 1. Confidentiality of FIS Confidential Information. You will treat all FIS Confidential Information as confidential, regardless of the form or format in which it was received. Specifically, you will (i) restrict the disclosure of the FIS Confidential Information in any form to anyone, other than your employees, advisors, contractors and affiliates who need to know or access the FIS Confidential Information in order to provide the services in accordance with the Agreement and are under legal obligations of confidentiality consistent with the requirements of this Amendment, (ii) use FIS Confidential Information only to provide the services contemplated by the Agreement, and make no unauthorized use of any FIS Confidential Information; (iii) instruct your employees, advisors, contractors and affiliates who have access to the FIS Confidential Information to protect and keep the same confidential; (iv) use (and instruct your employees, advisors, contractors and affiliates to use) the same degree of care to protect the FIS Confidential Information as you use to safeguard your own FIS Confidential Information of similar importance, but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care; (v) establish and maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards, designed to prevent the compromise or unauthorized disclosure of FIS Confidential Information and to achieve the objectives of the Regulations; (vi) promptly investigate any security breach to determine whether such incident has resulted or is likely to result in misuse of FIS Confidential Information; (vii) promptly notify FIS of any release or breach of the FIS Confidential Information and, in the case of NPI that you have, notify FIS and each of its affected clients or customers as soon as possible if an incident has resulted or is likely to result in misuse of NPI; and (viii) comply with the Regulations and all current and future regulations with regard to NPI that are applicable to you as a third party service provider. FIS Confidential Information is the property of FIS or if applicable, its affiliates or its clients. Except for NPI and payment card data, FIS Confidential Information does not include information that: (A) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of any disclosure or other action or inaction by you in breach of the Agreement (including any disclosure or other action or inaction by your employees, advisors or representatives that would constitute a breach of the Agreement if undertaken by you); (B) is or becomes known or available to you or any of your employees, advisors or representatives on a non-confidential basis from a source (other than FIS, its clients, their customers, or any of their advisors or representatives) that, to the best of the your knowledge, is not prohibited from disclosing such   FIS Confidential Information to you by a contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation, and not otherwise as a result of misappropriation or improper disclosure of such information by another party; (C) was in your possession prior to its being furnished or made accessible to you or your advisors or representatives by FIS, its clients, their customers, or any of their advisors or representatives or (D) you independently develop without the use of any FIS Confidential Information and without any violation of any obligation under the Agreement. Upon termination of the Agreement, you will destroy the FIS Confidential Information in a manner designed to preserve its confidentiality, or, at FIS’s written request and expense, return it to FIS. The foregoing obligations shall survive any termination of the Agreement. In addition to any other remedies to which it may be entitled, FIS will be entitled to an injunction (without bond) prohibiting any actual or threatened breach of such obligations. 2. Information Security. You will maintain security for your systems, servers, and communications links as necessary to protect your networks in accordance with your confidentiality obligations to FIS. Specifically, your information security program will (x) ensure the security and confidentiality of any NPI or payment card data that may come into your possession or control, (y) protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of all NPI or payment card data that may be in your possession, and (z) protect against unauthorized access to or use of NPI that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any of FIS’s clients or its client's customers. FIS reserves the right, upon reasonable notice and at mutually agreeable times during your normal hours of operation, to conduct an audit of your security controls, policies, standards, and procedures. If FIS notifies you of any deficiencies in your information security that could have an adverse impact on the services under the Agreement, you agree to discuss such deficiencies with FIS, including any mutually agreed to commercially reasonable remediation strategy to remedy such deficiencies in a timely manner. You will immediately investigate any security breach to determine whether it has resulted or is likely to result in an unauthorized use or disclosure of FIS Confidential Information, promptly notify FIS of any such breach, and if requested by FIS, reasonably assist in FIS’s notification of its affected clients and their customers. 3. Business Continuity. You will provide adequate recovery and continuity capabilities in order to support FIS contracted services. The terms and provisions set forth in this Amendment are a part of the Agreement and supersede any other terms and provisions that are inconsistent with this Amendment. All other terms and conditions of the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.
