BCG support of the FIS - Non-Corporate IT Process Redesign & Optimization & CIO Spend Analysis Ido, Bevan & Martha We are delighted to support you in redesigning and improving non-Corporate IT processes at FIS as a part of the company's bigger journey to drive more efficiency in processes and service delivery while enhancing the employee and customer experience. Our approach recognizes the guidelines you and your team have set for the redesign including: • Establishing a set of guiding principles founded on challenging the status quo and delivering benefits • Taking an employee centric approach (from both Business and IT), rooted in understanding of critical pain points in the employee journey • Assessing the current state of selected processes to identify quick wins that can be rapidly implemented and deliver immediate benefits • Reimagining processes from a blank slate ensuring the current state does not taint the art of the possible • Deliver on big vision targets for re-imagined processes- minimum STP of 70%\/process, reduction of end to end execution by 80-90%, 50% efficiency yield (driving 30-50% FTE reduction) • Recognizing the need for a secure environment while at the same time challenging the status quo • Designing change management into the process from the beginning by involving key stakeholders • Delivering an achievable roadmap that makes the right trade-offs between delivering targets\/benefits and managing the burden on the organization to implement re-imagined processes Further to our recent discussions, we understand that you have already begun work on Corporate IT processes and given the progress to date, you are now looking for support to redesign and improve non-Corporate IT processes. We also appreciate your desire to challenge the cost structure of the organization and will work with your team to analyze the baseline, assess programs in place and challenge the thinking allowing you to stretch farther and achieve greater results. The Boston Consulting Group Privileged and Confidential Page 2 Based on our experience supporting similar process redesign initiatives, we have put together this statement of work (\"SOW\") to describe how we can partner together to diagnose current challenges, reimagine processes and craft roadmap to address inefficiencies and realize benefits. In this document we will define three things: 1. Our proposed approach 2. Deliverables of the effort 3. Commercial details CONTEXT FIS is undertaking initiatives to reduce cost and redesign core IT processes in order to drive more efficiency in service delivery, an improved employee experience and tangible\/measurable cost reduction. Work is currently underway focused on Corporate IT processes that support the overwhelming majority of employee events routed to the IT helpdesk. You have made great progress in establishing a set of target outputs and deliverables. Expanding on your current work, you are now looking for support to redesign and improve non-Corporate IT processes: connectivity request, change management, event\/incident management, build request (pre and post) management, IT service requests (capacity, security and operating systems). Working with BCG we will bring an outside in perspective and external best practices to reimagine selected processes from a blank slate to deliver big vision targets - minimum STP of 70%\/process, reduction of end to end execution by 80-90%, 50% efficiency yield (driving 30-50% FTE reduction). The work will deliver a similar set of target outputs and deliverables in line with your effort on Corporate IT processes and will heavily leverage processes design principles, UX design standards and other artifacts to ensure consistency across efforts. In addition to examining processes, you have a desire to understand the shape of the overall IT cost reduction program. While performing the process work our team will take a hard look at the financial baseline of the combined company, examine the larger and more lucrative cost pools, generate a set of ideas of where you could push harder and review these with the senior IT leadership team. We will review your spend with external service providers, categorize that spend to the extent possible based on available data, and estimate the addressable spend and savings potential. The value at stake is material. It comes in the form of increased agility, reduced cycle times, increased STP, FTE reduction, and reduced friction across the process value chain leading to a better customer experience. We share your view that it is important to get it right the first time and implement with precision and speed to capture the full potential including the identification and implementation of quick wins where possible. The BCG team is committed to your success and will challenge your team to drive creative and impactful solutions. Our battle tested approach, key activities & deliverables are highlighted in the subsequent section. IMMEDIATE DEPLOYMENT AREAS -- SCOPE OF WORK, ACTIVITIES AND DELIVERABLES Part 1: Workplan & Activities: We have partnered closely with you to design a workplan that meets your immediate needs, as well as contemplates how these needs could potentially evolve through time. The basic shape we have agreed to is summarized below. As highlighted in Exhibit 1, to develop the final roadmap across employee experience, technology process execution & delivery and IT operating model, we will stage gate our effort into four steps: The Boston Consulting Group Privileged and Confidential Page 3 • Ramp up (1 week) o BCG to use the first week for data gathering o Ramp on current phase & completed artifacts (including the time studies completed by your teams to prioritize sub processes that present the greatest opportunities for improvement\/impact) o Alignment on vision and goals with core working teams o Define the governance model and communication plan for project o Kick-off change management by aligning on how, when and what to message to stakeholders over the duration of this initiatives o Assign FIS SMEs to support initiative, review and finalize workplan, including updates with steering committee o Finalize kickoff materials for week 2 (work product) • Baseline (2 weeks) o Current journey mapping or process flowcharts\/depictions for selected CIO processes o Financial baseline of both FIS and Worldpay IT organizations, heavily leveraging the information you have already collected o Diagnostic of seven CIO processes (cost, speed, complexity, pain points) and provide outside in BCG perspective o Analysis of select cost buckets (e.g. vendor spend, data center and operations, storage, application development, etc.) o Identify, validate, size and plan any quick wins that can be rapidly implemented to deliver quick impact o Best practice baseline (people, org alignment etc.) that support selected processes o Presentation on findings and opportunities (Deliverable PPT) End of this step to include an immersion workshop to align on current gaps and opportunities • Re-imagine (3 weeks) o Analysis of incremental cost out opportunities including ratio analysis of key metrics and additional levers to pull including organization, Agile and DevOps processes, location leverage (e.g. Development to Maintenance, User device ratios, ticket ratios, etc.) and third-party spend assessment for at least the 20 major vendors within hardware, software and services categories o Re-imagine selected CIO end to end employee journeys and processes from a blank slate and drive towards a set of target outcomes desired (e.g. target min STP of 70%\/process, target 80-90% reduction of end to end execution) o Codify the implementation needs including automation, changes to the existing technical architecture, and identification of other technical products that could facilitate the redesigned processes o Propose changes to operating model to support re-imagined processes and implications as they arise o Design change management into the process from the beginning by fully engaging key stakeholders o Impact assessment (e.g. speed, FTE reduction etc.) o Presentation on re-design on 7 core processes (deliverable(s) PPT\/Visio\/AdobeXD) End of this step to include an immersion workshop on imagination of the future • Roadmap (3 weeks) o Set of cost reduction ideas that either push your current thinking farther or are incremental to your existing list o Visualization of redesigned journeys and processes including continuous improvement review of the re-imagined processes and prototype based on executive feedback The Boston Consulting Group Privileged and Confidential Page 4 o Business case and overall roadmap, including additional tech and investments required o Roadmap for implementation and testing Submittal of project package to include designs, timeline and rollout phases (PPT\/EXCEL) End of this step to include an immersion workshop on roadmap alignment, plan and benefits Exhibit 1 (above): Proposed approach and activities The Boston Consulting Group Privileged and Confidential Page 5 Process Areas in scope Description Network Service Requests Simplify the requestor experience for End to End connection requests covering up to 12 functional groups, 40+ processes, utilizing 50+ forms. Guided end user process flow to simplify the CM steps to seamlessly drive the end user through the data entry process through to approval and implementation Driving the process so every request feels like a standard change request. Simply the end to end process from monitoring through to incident handling through to resolution, including reporting, root cause analysis Ability to easily review previous incidents (leverage KM) to help the technicians quickly address the issue with a timely response and document the root cause Seamless intake process through design of environment architecture to ensure the server build process incorporates all requirements for expected use of the environment Delivery needs to include, connectivity, security, capacity, patching etc This needs to fit into the bi-modal environment delivery for both cloud and FIS private cloud, tie into Infrastructure & Application pipeline for Cl CD. Additionally, including all CMDB maintenance. Reference Build Request Management that handles Architecture, Capacity (e g CPU, RAM, Storage, Network, etc ), Operating System Support and Security Requests (Access, Bit9, etc.) fulfillment. Additionally, support stand alone request for each IT service request type pre & post build for ongoing IT Maintenance. Exhibit 2 (above): In-scope process areas for redesign Part 2: Outcomes and Key deliverables across each stage: The key outcome of this project will be a completely reimagined set of processes that delivers improved efficiency, increased automation, reduced cost and improved customer experience, along with a change management rooted roadmap to implementing the target state. At each phase of the project, we will deliver the following outcomes and deliverables, which will build alignment towards the target state processes and roadmap. Note: Deliverables will be in PowerPoint format unless otherwise stated (e.g., Excel models) Subject to the BCG Terms (as defined below), the deliverables (e.g, visualization prototypes) from this project will be solely owned and the sole property of FIS, and will be in a state that can continue to be used and consumed after our engagement has completed. • Ramp up o Alignment on guiding principles: Overarching goals and rules on how we will operate o Finalized list of target processes (initial list outlined in Exhibit 1 above) o Detailed workplan: View of what we will do on a week-by-week basis, along with support from key FIS SMEs required to achieve project outcomes (Note: As the project proceeds, and sources of value are uncovered, we may request deviations from the initial workplan) o Governance structure: Alignment on composition of the Steering Committee, and identification of who will be on the project working team o Change management messaging and tactics to help staff embrace the change: Key messages, and cadence of messaging The Boston Consulting Group Privileged and Confidential Page 6 o Scheduling: Calendared meetings for Steering committee meetings, weekly working sessions, and immersion workshops • Baseline o IT Org. financial baseline: Current cost structure of FIS and Worldpay IT organizations in Excel format o Current state process: Articulation of current state processes, as journey maps, process flowcharts or value stream mapping - final format and level of detail to be determined based on based on usefulness of the artifacts (emphasis will be on defining target state) o Baseline for select processes (cost, speed, efficiency etc.): Quantitative assessment\/metrics of current state processes, along with along with high level size of the prize, in Excel model o Key pain points: Documentation of pain points from employee and customer\/user perspective o Potential quick wins: Definition of quick-wins identified within as-is processes (if any), along with steps required to action and implement the quick win. Will include sizing of cost and benefits in Excel format. • Re-imagine o Redesigned customer experience and target state processes: ■ Documentation of reimagined processes (including customer journey maps) at a level appropriate for implementation.

This section will survive the termination or expiry of any applicable Engagement. 7. INDEMNITY 7.1 BCG indemnifies and holds FIS and FIS’s Affiliates harmless from any Losses, arising out of (a) any claim by a third party of gross negligence, willful misconduct or failure to comply with applicable law, rules and regulations by BCG, any BCG Contractor, or any BCG Affiliate, in connection with performance under the Agreement, and (b) any claim by a third party that FIS's use of the Deliverables or BCG Tools as contemplated by the SOW infringes any third party intellectual property right, provided always that FIS's use of such Deliverables and BCG Tools is in compliance with the Agreement.

This restriction will not apply to any senior professionals who serve as BCG practice area leaders (PALs), any topic experts or advisors, who specialize in an industry, specific business discipline or the use of one of BCG Tools. The involvement of such an individual in the Engagement will not preclude them from working for other clients in FIS's industry. During the term of an Engagement and for one (1) year thereafter, neither Party will directly approach, counsel, or attempt to induce any person who is actively involved in the performance or review of the Services, to leave the other Party's employ or engagement, nor hire such person without the other Party's prior written consent, except that this Section will not restrict the employment of any person as a result of that person making an unsolicited response to a bona fide published general recruitment advertisement not specifically directed at such person. 9.6 Governing Law.

(3) Provider represents and warrants to FIS that the Products, as delivered by Provider to FIS, Clients or their customers, will not contain any Destructive Elements and that Provider will not install, use, or execute any Destructive Elements on any FIS computers, or computers of Clients or their customers. If FIS notifies Provider that it has been informed of or has reason to believe that a Destructive Element was present in the Products as delivered by Provider to FIS, a Client, or any customers of a Client, Provider will promptly assist and work continuously with FIS, in conformance with FIS security requirements, at no charge, until, in the determination of FIS, the Destructive Element has been eliminated.

(5) Provider represents and warrants that there is no action, suit, arbitration proceeding, investigation or inquiry pending or threatened against Provider, its business or any of its assets, and that Provider does not know or have grounds to know, of any basis for any such actions, suits, arbitrations, proceedings, investigations or inquiries, that would affect its ability to perform its obligations under the Agreement.

FIS may, without consent or notice, assign the Agreement to an FIS Affiliate or pursuant to any merger or acquisition of all or substantially all of its assets. In addition, FIS may partially assign the Agreement, or any statement of work or other contract made under the Agreement, with respect to any Product or Services used by an FIS Affiliate, or a division, department or other segment of FIS or an FIS Affiliate, that is the subject of a divestiture by FIS or an FIS Affiliate (regardless of the form of transaction) pursuant to a mutually acceptable Partial Assignment Agreement between FIS or the FIS Affiliate, Provider and the assignee in a form similar to the attached Exhibit A. 10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. Provider’s liability will be unlimited with respect to death, personal injury, property damage, or any indemnification obligation arising under the Agreement. No limitation of liability will apply to limit Provider’s liability to less than the total amount paid or payable under the Agreement or one million dollars ($1,000,000), whichever is greater. Under no circumstances will FIS have any obligation to Provider under any theory of liability or otherwise for any losses caused directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by (i) Provider, (ii) a third party other than FIS’s authorized agents, (iii) adherence to Provider’s specifications, (iv) improper or incomplete systems, data, software or equipment supplied by Provider, (v) a Force Majeure Event or (vi) anything not attributable to FIS or under FIS’s ability to control. Additionally, except for FIS’s obligation to pay fees to Provider, FIS’S TOTAL LIABILITY TO PROVIDER ARISING FROM THE AGREEMENT IS LIMITED IN ALL CASES AND IN THE AGGREGATE TO THE AMOUNT OF FEES ACTUALLY PAID BY FIS TO PROVIDER PURSUANT TO THE AGREEMENT DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE DATE OF THE EVENT THAT IS THE BASIS FOR THE FIRST CLAIM.

OWNERSHIP a. WORKS FOR HIRE. Any and all inventions and works pursuant to or resulting from the Services will be considered works made for hire by Provider and upon creation will be owned exclusively by FIS. To the extent that such inventions or works may not be considered works made for hire, Provider hereby assigns, without the necessity of further consideration, all of its right, title and interest therein to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser will be entitled to hold same in its own name on all applicable patents, registrations or copyrights. b. ASSIGNMENTS. If and to the extent Provider may, under any Law, be entitled to claim any ownership interest, or moral rights, in the inventions or works related to the Services, Provider transfers, grants, conveys, and Procurement Contract Supplement Pg. 10 of 12 Ver. 02-03-2015 DocuSign Envelope ID: 4740FF76-5178-4906-B9CE-AA5A176ABF6F relinquishes exclusively to FIS all of its right, title and interest under patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark Law, to the extent allowable by Law, in perpetuity or for the longest period otherwise permitted by Law. c. OTHER DOCUMENTS.

Provider will also sign, upon FIS’s request, any document necessary for the filing and prosecution of patent, trademark or copyright applications with respect to such rights in the United States and elsewhere, including divisional, continuation, revival, renewal or reissue application. Provider will cooperate and assist FIS in preparing, filing and prosecuting any and all such patent, trademark and copyright applications during the Term and for two (2) years following the date Provider ceases to perform the Services. FIS will bear all costs associated with the prosecution of such patent, trademark or copyright applications. d. LICENSE. To the extent that any preexisting rights are embodied or reflected in the Services, inventions or works related to the Services or inventions, Provider grants to FIS an irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, world-wide, royalty-free right and license to (i) use, execute, reproduce, display, perform, distribute copies of and prepare derivative works based upon such preexisting rights, and (ii) authorize others on FIS's behalf to do any or all of the foregoing. 12. DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND APPLICABLE LAW. Any dispute, difference, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the Agreement will be settled by binding arbitration before a single arbitrator in San Francisco, California in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules (including Procedures for Large, Complex Commercial Disputes) of the American Arbitration Association. Judgment on any resulting award may be entered into by any court having competent jurisdiction over the parties or their respective property. The arbitrator will decide any issues submitted in accordance with the provisions and commercial purposes of the Agreement, and will not have the power to award damages in excess of the limitations set forth in, or excluded by, the Agreement. The Agreement will be governed by the Law of the State of New York, without regard to internal principles relating to conflict of laws. Nothing in the Agreement will prevent either party from seeking preliminary or temporary injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction for the other party’s breach of its information security or confidentiality obligations under the Agreement. 13. AMENDMENTS; AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVES. This Supplement and the Agreement may be modified only by a written instrument signed by duly authorized representatives of both parties. 14. USAGE AND INTERPRETATION a. ENGLISH LANGUAGE. English will be the language of the Agreement. Translation of the Agreement, its attachments, schedules, exhibits, correspondence, documents, invoices, notices or other communications related to the Agreement, or the transactions thereunder, into another language will be at the sole risk of the translating party. In the event any conflicts arise between the English version of the Agreement and a translated version, the English version will prevail. If permitted under local Law, all communications pursuant to the Agreement will be conducted in the English language. Unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, (i) references to a party’s agreement, consent, notice, request or approval mean written and signed agreement, consent, notice or approval, (ii) the words “will” and “shall” have the same meaning, which is obligatory, and (iii) the word “including” means “including, without limitation”(so that it does not limit the scope of the word or phrase to which it is applied). b. WEB-BASED PROVISIONS AND PASSIVE CONTRACTS. The effectiveness of the Agreement, or of any statement or other contract made under the Agreement, will not be conditioned upon FIS becoming bound by (i) a reference in the Agreement to one or more documents maintained by Provider and made available to FIS at a Web page, by email distribution or in any other manner or (ii) a “click-through”, “shrink wrap” or similar mechanism presented by Provider (whether in the past, present or future) involving the use of an action other than actual signature or electronic signature (as recognized by Law) to cause agreement to terms and conditions presented by Provider. The parties understand and agree that any such documents, terms and conditions will be only for (A) informational purposes or to set forth obligations of or rights granted by the Provider or its Affiliates, (B) that neither FIS nor any FIS Affiliate will be bound by any contractual obligation that might otherwise arise from any such reference or mechanism, whether under or in connection with the Agreement or otherwise, and (C) that any such documents, terms and conditions will in any event be subject to this Supplement. 15.

This Assignment may be modified or waived, in whole or in part, only by a written document signed by all parties. c) No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right, power, or privilege under this Assignment will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder. d) The parties each covenant and agree to execute, to acknowledge and to deliver, at their own expense, such other instruments and to take such other actions as may be reasonably required to effectuate this Assignment whenever and so often as reasonably required so to do by the parties hereto, their successors and assigns. e) Failure by any party to enforce at any time any of the terms and conditions of this Assignment will not be considered a waiver of that party’s right to enforce such terms and conditions.

CONFIDENTIALITY 9.1 Each Party will, and each will procure that its personnel will keep confidential all Confidential Information of, or concerning, the other's Confidential Information received by it. 9.2 Clause 9.1 does not apply to information: (a) that is published or otherwise generally becomes available to the public, except as a result of a breach of this Agreement; (b) made available to a Party on a non-confidential basis; (c) to the extent required to be disclosed by any Law making body or Regulatory Authority, provided that the disclosing Party notifies the other, to the extent legally permissible, of the information to be disclosed as early as reasonably practicable before the disclosure and takes all reasonable action to avoid or limit the disclosure; (d) was developed independently by the receiving Party without access to, or use or knowledge of, the Confidential Information; or (e) that is already known by the receiving Party without any obligation of confidence. 9.3 Clause 9.1 will not restrict the sharing of any Confidential Information by the receiving Party to its personnel or professional advisors who need to know it to provide the Services and\/or to manage the relationship between the Parties, provided that such persons use it solely for such purpose and are under an obligation to the receiving Party to keep such information confidential. 9.4 Other than as expressly permitted under this Agreement, on termination of this Agreement for whatever reason, each Party will immediately: (a) cease to use any Confidential Information of the other and will return on written demand or, at the other's election, destroy or, so far as is reasonably practicable, permanently erase all copies of that Confidential Information in its possession or control; and (b) certify to the other Party within ten (10) Business Days of the date of termination that this has been done, save that a Party will be permitted to retain such part of that Confidential Information only for the purposes of, and 9 DocuSign Envelope ID: 0BB76D70-BB72-4DD3-9875-5C786CE6FE70 for so long as required by, any Law or its legitimate internal compliance requirements. 9.5 The Supplier shall indemnify Worldpay, its Group Companies, officers and\/or directors against all Losses suffered or incurred by Worldpay, its Group Companies, officers and\/or directors arising out of or in connection with the Supplier's breach of this clause 9. 9.6 The Parties each agree that damages may not be an adequate remedy for any breach of this Clause 9 and, notwithstanding clause 20 (Disputes), the disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek any legal and\/or equitable relief, including an injunction, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this clause 9 in addition to its other remedies under this Agreement or otherwise. 10. SAFEGUARDING DATA 10.1 If the Supplier has access to any Worldpay Data that is Personal Data then the provisions of Part A of Schedule 7 shall apply; if the Supplier has access to any Worldpay Data that is Cardholder Data or any environment storing or processing Cardholder Data, Part B of Schedule 7 shall apply. 11. INFORMATION SECURITY 11.1 Without limiting clause 9.1, the Supplier shall establish, implement and regularly maintain security, processes and plans (the \"Supplier Security Plan”) which shall ensure the confidentiality and security of the Confidential Information, any Worldpay Data, and the Deliverables in accordance with Good Industry Practice and the requirements set out in Schedule 6. 11.2 The Supplier shall ensure that at all times it is operating in accordance with the terms of the Supplier Security Plan. 11.3 The Supplier will on Worldpay's request provide Worldpay or any third party acting on behalf of Worldpay with copies of the Supplier Security Plan and any other documentation relating to the Supplier's compliance with the Agreement's information security requirements and will explain how the Supplier Security Plan meets such information security requirements. 11.4 In the provision of the Services, the Supplier will adopt and use good development and coding practices in line with Good Industry Practice and adhere to any industry standards specified in the SOW. The Supplier will ensure that any application code or other materials developed for Worldpay are sufficiently tested and assured so as to ensure that common security flaws and vulnerabilities are not introduced into Worldpay's systems, products, services or websites. 11.5 The Supplier shall perform Security Tests of its systems (\"Supplier Security Tests”) in a manner and frequency expected in accordance with Good Industry Practice to ensure the Supplier is operating in accordance with the Supplier Security Plan and will share the results of the Supplier Security Tests with Worldpay on request. The Supplier shall permit Worldpay or a security consultant selected and approved by Worldpay to carry out penetration tests on the Supplier's systems (\"Worldpay Security Tests”). The Supplier shall provide Worldpay with all reasonable assistance to enable Worldpay to perform the Worldpay Security Tests. 11.6 If Worldpay considers (acting reasonably) that controls identified or tested in the performance of the Supplier Security Tests or the Worldpay Security Tests: (a) are insufficient to ensure the integrity and security of Worldpay's Confidential Information; or (b) fail to meet the requirements of any Regulatory Authority applicable to Worldpay; or (c) fail to meet industry standards relating to data or information security, then Worldpay may require the Supplier to remedy such insufficiency or failure and the Supplier (at its own cost) shall, as soon as is reasonably practicable, make those modifications. Where the additional measures affect the Supplier's subcontractors, suppliers and agents, the Supplier shall procure that those measures are implemented by the relevant subcontractors, suppliers and agents. 11.7 Upon any suspected or actual breach of any obligations or duties owed by the Supplier to 10 DocuSign Envelope ID: 0BB76D70-BB72-4DD3-9875-5C786CE6FE70 Worldpay relating to information security or confidentiality, including any suspected or actual non-compliance with the Supplier Security Plan which affects the security and\/or confidentiality obligation of the Supplier, the Supplier will immediately remedy the breach and will promptly: (a) notify Worldpay of the breach and the Supplier's proposed remedial measures; (b) implement any actions or remedial measures at its own cost which Worldpay considers necessary as a result of the breach; and (c) provide Worldpay with evidence of the implementation of such remedial measures. 11.8 A breach of this clause 11 shall be a material breach which Worldpay may elect to treat as not capable of remedy for the purposes of this Agreement. 12. BRIBERY 12.1 The Supplier warrants and represents that it and its Personnel shall comply with any applicable Law in force from time to time and receive training at least annually regarding bribery, fraudulent acts and\/or any other corrupt practice. 12.2 If the Supplier, its Personnel or anyone acting on the Supplier's behalf (in all cases whether or not acting with the Supplier's knowledge) breaches this clause 12 Worldpay may terminate this Agreement by written notice with immediate effect. 12.3 The Supplier shall indemnify Worldpay, its Group Companies, officers and\/or directors against all Losses suffered or incurred by Worldpay, its Group Companies, officers and\/or directors arising out of or in connection with the Supplier's breach of this clause 12. 13.

LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY 14.1 Nothing in this Agreement shall operate so as to exclude or limit the liability of either Party to the other for: (a) death or personal injury arising out of negligence or fraud; (b) any liability arising in connection with clauses 8.4, 9.5, 12.3, 17 and Schedule 7; (c) the consequences of any wilful default or abandonment of this Agreement (or any SOW, if applicable); or (d) any other liability which cannot be excluded or limited by law. 14.2 Subject to clause 14.1 and 14.4, the total aggregate liability of Worldpay to the Supplier under or in connection with this Agreement including liability for breach of contract, misrepresentation (whether tortious or statutory), tort (including, but not limited to, negligence), breach of statutory duty or otherwise, shall not exceed the total Charges paid to the Supplier under this Agreement. 14.3 Subject to clauses 14.1 and 14.4, the Supplier's total aggregate liability to Worldpay and the Group under or in connection with this Agreement including liability for breach of contract, misrepresentation (whether tortious or statutory), tort (including, but not limited to, negligence), breach of statutory duty or otherwise, shall not exceed the total Charges paid or payable under this Agreement and any SOW. 14.4 Save where specifically set out otherwise in this Agreement or an SOW, neither Party shall be liable, whether in tort (including for negligence or breach of statutory duty), contract, misrepresentation or otherwise for any special, indirect or consequential losses or damage (whether such losses or damage are foreseen, foreseeable, known or otherwise). 14.5 The Supplier shall maintain at its own cost insurance policies with a Reputable Insurance Company (means an insurance provider with a Standard & Poor's credit rating of at least AA- (or with an equivalent rating)) to cover potential liabilities which the Supplier may have to Worldpay under this Agreement or any SOW including: (a) (each in the amount of at least £5 million): Employers Liability, Professional Indemnity Liability\/Cyber and Data Breach insurance; and (b) Public Liability and Product Liability insurance in the amount of at least £5 million. Within seven (7) days of any request by Worldpay, the Supplier shall provide Worldpay with a copy of the insurance policies and any certificate from its insurers or insurance brokers confirming that the insurance is in force and that the current premiums 12 DocuSign Envelope ID: 0BB76D70-BB72-4DD3-9875-5C786CE6FE70 have been paid. 14.6 The Supplier shall maintain insurance policies which incorporate the automatic noting of interests of contracting parties without specific endorsement of named companies and which provide thirty (30) days prior written notice of any cancellation, non-renewal, or material amendment to be given to Worldpay, where any of the foregoing could materially reduce the amount and or scope of the insurances. The insurance policies referred to in clause 14.5 shall include: (a) an indemnity to principals clause providing for an indemnity to Worldpay as principal against legal liability in respect of which the Supplier would have been entitled to an indemnity under the insurance if the claim had been made against the Supplier provided that Worldpay as principal shall, be subject to the terms of the insurance in so far as they can apply; and (b) a clause waiving the insurer's subrogation rights against Worldpay, its employees and agents. 15.

If Worldpay considers (on reasonable grounds) that the BCDR Plan is insufficient to ensure the continued performance and operational resilience of the Services or fails to meet the requirements of any Regulator then Worldpay may require the Supplier to modify the BCDR Plan to cure such insufficiency or failure and the Supplier will promptly make the modifications that Worldpay require. 16.5 If a Force Majeure Event directly prevents a Party (the \"Affected Party”) from complying with any of its obligations under this Agreement and\/or any SOW (as applicable), the Affected Party may be excused from performance, and any liability for non-performance, of those obligations, for the duration of the Force Majeure Event, save that a Party is not entitled to rely on this clause 16.5 to the extent that it fails to take all reasonable steps to mitigate, avoid, circumvent, overcome and\/or minimise the period of the delay (including in the case of the Supplier, to implement the BCDR Plan) or to provide reasonable precautions or workarounds. The Affected Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to recommence performance or observance whenever and to whatever extent possible without 13 DocuSign Envelope ID: 0BB76D70-BB72-4DD3-9875-5C786CE6FE70 delay. 16.6 A Force Majeure Event shall not relieve the Supplier of its obligations to comply with the BCDR Plan, including requiring that essential Personnel report to work at a contingency location. 16.7 A breach of clause 16.1, 16.2, 16.3 and\/or 16.4 shall be a material breach which Worldpay may elect to treat as not capable of remedy for the purposes of this Agreement. 17. TUPE 17.1 The Supplier agrees to arrange Personnel in relation to the Services in such a way that no individual at any time (a) forms part of an organised grouping of employees which has as its principal purpose the provision of the Services or (b) no Personnel is\/are wholly or mainly assigned to the provision of the Services. 17.2 The parties agree and acknowledge that on the expiry of this Agreement, an SOW or at the cessation of any Services being provided by the Supplier (referred to as the \"End Date” for the purposes of this Agreement), the parties do not intend that any of the employees of either Party or their respective subcontractors will transfer to the other under the provisions of the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 (SI 2006\/246) as amended or replaced or any other regulations implementing the Acquired Rights Directive (\"TUPE”). 17.3 If any Personnel who were employed or otherwise engaged immediately prior to the End Date (\"Affected Employee”) should claim to be employed by Worldpay or a replacement supplier to Worldpay as a result of the provisions of TUPE applying in relation to this Agreement or an SOW then Worldpay shall, upon becoming aware of such claim, notify the Supplier in writing within fourteen (14) days and allow the Supplier the period of twenty eight (28) days from receipt of such notification either to offer employment to that person or take other steps with a view to obtaining a written withdrawal of that person's claim to be employed by Worldpay or a replacement supplier. 17.4 If the Affected Employee accepts employment with the Supplier, Worldpay shall immediately release that person from its employment or alleged employment. 17.5 The Supplier shall: (a) remain responsible throughout the period between the End Date and either the date of withdrawal of the Affected Employee's claim or the Supplier's release (per clause 17.4) for the payment of all salary and benefits to that person; and (b) indemnify Worldpay against all Employee Liabilities arising out of or in connection with non-payment of the same. 17.6 If the Affected Employee's claim that they are employed by Worldpay or a replacement supplier is not withdrawn or resolved within twenty eight (28) days of the Supplier being notified, Worldpay or the replacement supplier may terminate the Affected Employee's employment within fourteen (14) days of the twenty eight (28) Business Day period expiring. In such circumstances, the Supplier shall indemnify Worldpay against all Employee Liabilities arising out of or in connection with: (i) any claim or other legal recourse brought by the Affected Employee in respect of any fact or matter concerning or arising from their employment with the Supplier or its subcontractor and\/or their transfer to Worldpay or a replacement supplier; (ii) such person's salary and benefits; and (iii) the termination of the employment of such Affected Employee for whatever reason but excluding any Employee Liabilities arising out of or in connection with any claim of discrimination in respect of the act of termination itself by Worldpay or a replacement supplier, any failure on Worldpay's or a replacement supplier's part to follow any statutory minimum dismissal procedures or the payment by Worldpay or a replacement supplier of any ex gratia sum or settlement which is 14 DocuSign Envelope ID: 0BB76D70-BB72-4DD3-9875-5C786CE6FE70 not approved in writing in advance by the Supplier (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 17.7 In the event that TUPE applies to any Personnel, the Supplier shall indemnify Worldpay, its Group Companies, officers and\/or directors against all Losses suffered or incurred by Worldpay, its Group Companies, officers and\/or directors arising out of or in connection with Worldpay's compliance with TUPE or any failure by the Supplier, its subcontractors and\/or Personnel to comply with TUPE in relation to their employees and\/or the transfer of such employees. 17.8 Both parties shall comply with Regulation 13 of TUPE in so far as TUPE applies to that Party and shall share information with each other and any replacement suppliers to enable each Party to comply with the same. 17.9 Worldpay may in its absolute discretion assign the benefit of the indemnities contained in this clause 17 to a replacement supplier or replacement suppliers. 18. CHANGE CONTROL 18.1 A change to all or any part of the Agreement and\/or an SOW shall only be agreed in accordance with this clause 18. 18.2 Either Party may request in writing a change to the Services (\"Change Request”) by notifying the other's Representative. 18.3 The Supplier Representative will, within ten (10) Business Days of receiving a Worldpay Change Request, explain to Worldpay's Representative in writing what impact implementing that Change Request would have upon the Charges, any delivery dates and (where appropriate) the Services (\"Change Information”). 18.4 Worldpay will have fifteen (15) Business Days following receipt of the Change Information to accept or reject the proposed change to the Services. The Parties' Representatives shall agree the terms of the change in writing which, once signed by both Parties, shall constitute a change to this Agreement and\/or the relevant SOW. 18.5 Any change to an SOW made in accordance with this clause shall be made in the form of the template set out in Schedule 4, or such other form as the Parties agree. 19.

Customer agrees that on at least a quarterly basis it will review searches performed by its User IDs to ensure that such searches were performed for a legitimate business purpose and in compliance with all terms and conditions herein. Customer will implement policies and procedures to prevent unauthorized use of User IDs and the LN Services and will immediately notify LN, in writing to the LN Privacy, Security and Compliance Organization at 1000 Aiderman Drive, Alpharetta, Georgia 30005 and by email (security. investiqations(S)lexisnexis. com) and by phone (1-888-872¬ 5375), if Customer suspects, has reason to believe or confirms that a User ID or the LN Services (or data derived directly or indirectly therefrom) is or has been lost, stolen, compromised, misused or used, accessed or acquired in an unauthorized manner or by any unauthorized person, or for any purpose other than legitimate business reasons. Customer shall remain solely liable for all costs associated therewith and shall further reimburse LN for any expenses it incurs due to Customer's failure to prevent such impermissible use or access of User IDs and\/or the LN Services, or any actions required as a result thereof. Furthermore, in the event that the LN Services provided to the Customer include personally identifiable information (including, but not limited to, social security numbers, driver's license numbers or dates of birth), the following shall apply: Customer acknowledges that, upon unauthorized acquisition or access of or to such personally identifiable information, including but not limited to that which is due to use by an unauthorized person or due to unauthorized use (a \"Security Event\"), Customer shall, in compliance with law, notify the individuals whose information was potentially accessed or acquired that a Security Event has occurred, and shall also notify any other parties (including but not limited to regulatory entities and credit reporting agencies) as may be required in LN's reasonable discretion. Customer agrees that such notification shall not reference LN or the product through which the data was provided, nor shall LN be otherwise identified or referenced in connection with the Security Event, without LN's express written consent.

Customer shall remain solely liable for claims that may arise from a Security Event, including, but not limited to, costs for litigation (including attorneys fees), and reimbursement sought by individuals, including but not limited to, costs for credit monitoring or allegations of loss in connection with the Security Event, and to the extent that any claims are brought against LN, shall indemnify LN from such claims. Customer shall provide samples of all proposed materials to notify consumers and any third-parties, including regulatory entities, to LN for review and approval prior to distribution. In the event of a Security Event, LN may, in its sole discretion, take immediate action, including suspension or termination of Customer's account, without further obligation or liability of any kind. 4. PERFORMANCE. LN will use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver the LN Services requested by Customer and to compile information gathered from selected public records and other sources used in the provision of the LN Services; provided, however, that the Customer accepts all information \"AS IS\". Customer acknowledges and agrees that LN obtains its data from third party sources, which may or may not be completely thorough and accurate, and that Customer shall not rely on LN for the accuracy or completeness of information supplied through the LN Services. Without limiting the foregoing, the criminal record data that may be provided as part of the LN Services may include records that have been expunged, sealed, or otherwise have become inaccessible to the public since the date on which the data was last updated or collected. Customer understands that Customer may be restricted from accessing certain LN Services which may be otherwise available. LN resen\/es the right to add materials and features to, and to discontinue offering any of the materials and features that are currently a part of, the LN Services. In the event that LN discontinues a material portion of the materials and features that Customer regularly uses in the ordinary course of its business, and such materials and features are part of a flat fee subscription plan to which Customer has subscribed, LN will, at Customer's option, issue a prorated credit to Customer's account. 5. PRICING SCHEDULES. Upon acceptance by the LN Affiliate(s) set forth on an applicable Schedule A, such LN Affiliate(s) shall provide the LN Services requested by Customer and set forth in one (1) or more Schedules A attached hereto or subsequently incorporated by reference, for the fees listed on such schedules. The fees listed on a Schedule A may be updated from time to time through any or all of the following methods: online announcements, customer bulletins, emails, notices, announcements in invoices, or published price schedules. LN is not responsible for ensuring delivery of such updates, changes, additions, or deletions to any of its pricing policies that may occur from time to time. All current and future pricing documents are deemed incorporated herein by reference. 6. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; CONFIDENTIALITY. Customer agrees that Customer shall not reproduce, retransmit, republish, or otherwise transfer for any commercial purposes the LN Services’ information, programs or computer applications. Customer acknowledges that LN (and\/or its third party data providers) shall retain all right, title, and interest under applicable contractual, copyright, patent, trademark, Trade Secret and related laws in and to the LN Services and the data and information that they provide. Customer shall use such materials in a manner consistent with LN’s interests and the terms and conditions herein, and shall notify LN of any threatened or actual infringement of LN’s rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, LN shall own Customer's search inquiry data used to access the LN Services (in the past or future) and may use such data for any purpose consistent with applicable federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations. Customer and LN acknowledge that they each may have access to confidential information of the disclosing party (\"Disclosing Party\") relating to the Disclosing Party's business including, without limitation, technical, financial, strategies and related information, computer programs, algorithms, know-how, processes, ideas, inventions (whether patentable or not), schematics, Trade Secrets (as defined below) and other information (whether written or oral), and in the case of LN's information, product information, pricing information, product development plans, forecasts, data contained in LN Services, and other business information (\"Confidential Information\"). Confidential Information shall not include information that: (i) is or becomes (through no improper action or inaction by the Receiving Party (as defined below)) generally known to the public; (ii) Risk Non-FCRA Application & Agreement (Q4.11 ,v1)' Confidential Page 8 of 11 was in the Receiving Party's possession or known by it prior to receipt from the Disclosing Party; (iii) was lawfully disclosed to Receiving Party by a third-party and received in good faith and without any duty of confidentiality by the Receiving Party or the third- party; or (iv) was independently developed without use of any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party by employees of the Receiving Party who have had no access to such Confidential Information. \"Trade Secret\" shall be deemed to include any information which gives the Disclosing Party an advantage over competitors who do not have access to such information as well as all information that fits the definition of \"trade secret\" set forth in the Official Code of Georgia Annotated § 10-1-761(4). Each receiving party (\"Receiving Party\") agrees not to divulge any Confidential Information or information derived therefrom to any third-party and shall protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information with the same degree of care it uses to protect the confidentiality of its own confidential information and trade secrets, but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information solely to the extent required by subpoena, court order or other governmental authority, provided that the Receiving Party shall give the Disclosing party prompt written notice of such subpoena, court order or other governmental authority so as to allow the Disclosing party to have an opportunity to obtain a protective order to prohibit or restrict such disclosure at its sole cost and expense. Confidential Information disclosed pursuant to subpoena, court order or other governmental authority shall otherwise remain subject to the terms applicable to Confidential Information. Each party's obligations with respect to Confidential Information shall continue for the term of this Agreement and for a period of five (5) years thereafter, provided however, that with respect Trade Secrets, each party's obligations shall continue for so long as such Confidential Information continues to constitute a Trade Secret. 7. PAYMENT OF FEES. Customer shall be responsible for payment for all services ordered by Customer or obtained through Customer's User IDs after the expiration of a free trial if applicable, whether or not such User ID is used by Customer or a third-party, provided access to the User ID is not the result of use by a person formerly or presently employed by LN or who obtains the User ID by or through a break-in or unauthorized access of LN's offices, premises, records, or documents. Customer shall pay to LN the fees incurred for the use of the LN Services, and Customer agrees that it may be electronically invoiced for those fees. Payments shall be received within twenty (20) days of the invoice date. Any balance not timely paid will accrue interest at the rate of eighteen percent (18%) per annum. Customer's obligation to pay invoiced amounts is absolute and unconditional and not subject to any offset, defense or counterclaim. LN will assess a returned check fee of Twenty-Five Dollars ($25) or the maximum amount allowed under applicable law for any check draft payments to LN which are returned unpaid for reason of insufficient funds. If Customer's account is placed for collection with a third-party collection agency, Customer agrees to pay a collections fee in the amount of the greater of Twenty-Five Dollars ($25.00) or twenty five percent (25%) of the amount placed for collection. 8. TERM OF AGREEMENT. This Agreement is for services rendered and shall be in full force and effect during such periods of time during which LN is providing services for Customer (the \"Term\"); provided, however, that any term provided on a Schedule A (the \"Schedule A Term\") shall apply to the LN Services provided under such schedule until the expiration of that Schedule A Term. Upon expiration of any Schedule A Term, this Agreement shall continue in effect for so long as LN is providing services for Customer. 9. TERMINATION. Except where a Schedule A provides for a Schedule A Term or otherwise sets forth Customer's minimum financial commitment, either party may terminate this Agreement at any time for any reason. 10. GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Georgia, without effect to conflicts of law principles. Additionally, any action brought pursuant to Customer's use of the LN Services or pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be brought within the jurisdiction of the courts of Fulton County, Georgia. 11. ASSIGNMENT. The license granted pursuant to this Agreement to Customer to use the LN Services may not be assigned by Customer, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of LN. For purposes of this Agreement, a change in control of Customer of twenty percent (20%) or more shall constitute an assignment. 12. WARRANTIES\/LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. Neither LN, nor its subsidiaries and affiliates, nor any third-party data provider (for purposes of indemnification, warranties, and limitations on liability, LN, its subsidiaries and affiliates, and its data providers are hereby collectively referred to as \"LN\") shall be liable to Customer (or to any person claiming through Customer to whom Customer may have provided data from the LN Services) for any loss or injury arising out of or caused in whole or in part by LN's acts or omissions in procuring, compiling, collecting, interpreting, reporting, communicating, or delivering the LN Services. If, notwithstanding the foregoing, liability can be imposed on LN, then Customer agrees that LN's aggregate liability for any and all losses or injuries arising out of any act or omission of LN in connection with anything to be done or furnished under this Agreement, regardless of the cause of the loss or injury, and regardless of the nature of the legal or equitable right claimed to have been violated, shall never exceed One Hundred Dollars ($100.00); and Customer covenants and promises that it will not sue LN for an amount greater than such sum even if Customer and\/or third-parties were advised of the possibility of such damages and that it will not seek punitive damages in any suit against LN. LN does not make and hereby disclaims any warranty, express or implied, with respect to the LN Services. LN does not guarantee or warrant the correctness, completeness, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose of the LN Services or information provided therein. In no event shall LN be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages, however arising, incurred by Customer from receipt or use of information delivered hereunder or the unavailability thereof. Due to the nature of public record information, the public records and commercially available data sources used in LN Services may contain errors. Source data is sometimes reported or entered inaccurately, processed poorly or incorrectly, and is generally not free from defect. LN Services are not the source of data, nor are they a comprehensive compilation of the data. Before relying on any data, it should be independently verified.

The HIPAA Section is deleted and replaced as follows: HIPAA. CenturyLink does not require or intend to access Customer data in its performance hereunder, including but not limited to any confidential health related information of Customer’s clients, which may include group health plans, that constitutes Protected Health Information (“PHI”), as defined in 45 C.F. R. §160.103 under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA Rules”).

Any new pricing applicable to Customer’s existing Services, if any, will become effective at CenturyLink QCC’s earliest opportunity, but in no event later than the second full billing cycle following the Amendment Effective Date (“Billing Change Date”).

CenturyLink will, through its affiliate, Savvis Communications Corporation DBA CenturyLink TS and its affiliates (“CenturyLink TS”), provide CenturyLink TS services under the terms of the Agreement, this Service Exhibit, a Service Order and\/or Statement of Work (“SOW”). For clarification, CenturyLink TS shall be used when it is necessary to specify the CenturyLink TS affiliate, and otherwise CenturyLink and its affiliates shall hereinafter be referred to as “CenturyLink”. In the event of a conflict in any term of any documents that govern the provision of Services hereunder, the following order of precedence will apply in descending order of control: the Service Schedule, this Service Exhibit, the Agreement, any Service Guide, the SLA, the Service Order(s) and SOW(s). Capitalized terms not defined herein are defined in the Agreement. “BCD” or “Billing Commencement Date” means the date on which CenturyLink begins billing for a Service, as further defined in Billing Section 3.2. \"Service\" means the service provided by CenturyLink through its affiliate, including CenturyLink TS or Tier 3 and\/or their licensors and contractors as set forth on the Service Order or SOW .\"Service Guide\" (or \"SG\") means the product-specific Service guide that includes technical specifications which can be found at http:\/\/www.centurylink.com\/technology\/service-guides, which CenturyLink TS may modify from time to time, effective upon posting on the Web site. \"Service Order\" means a service order request submitted on a form issued by CenturyLink and signed by Customer that includes the type and details of the specific Services ordered by Customer. \"Service Schedule\" means those service descriptions providing additional terms pursuant to which CenturyLink will provide and Customer shall purchase the Services described therein. The applicable Service Schedules are included in this Service Exhibit. \"SLA\" or “SLA Attachment” means the service level agreement applicable to each individual Service, if any, which provides Customer's sole and exclusive remedies for any Service quality or performance deficiencies or failures of any kind (e.g., uptime, latency). To clarify, such sole and exclusive SLA remedies shall not apply to breaches of unrelated obligations under the Agreement such as infringement, confidentiality, etc. CenturyLink may modify SLAs during a renewal term upon 60 days’ notice. 2. Term. Services have a minimum term which begins on the BCD and continues for the period set forth in the relevant Service Order or SOW (\"Initial Service Term\"), at the conclusion of which the Service will automatically renew for successive periods equal to 12 months, unless terminated by either party in writing at least 60 days prior to the expiration of the then-current Service Term. The Initial Service Term and any renewal terms are collectively referred to as the \"Service Term\". 3. Rates; Billing. 3.1 Rates. Customer will pay all applicable rates and fees set forth in the relevant Service Order and\/or SOW. Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary and not more than once per calendar year, CenturyLink may increase the charges applicable to any Service provided hereunder in an amount not to exceed the latest annual increase in the Consumer Price Index, specifically, the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics \"All Items Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) for the U.S. City Average\". Such increase shall be effective upon the date set forth in CenturyLink’s written notice thereof to Customer. CenturyLink may otherwise increase applicable charges as set forth on a particular Service Order or upon prior written notice during any automatic renewal term. 3.2 Billing. The BCD for the Service is the earlier of (i) the date on which Customer uses (except during the Acceptance Period) the Service or (ii) the date CenturyLink notifies Customer in writing that the initial installation or a usable part thereof (such as a data circuit between two points or an individual data center installation on a multi-data center project) is complete. For Professional Services in a SOW, the BCD shall be the date CenturyLink begins performing the Services or as specified in the SOW. Customer shall have three business days after such use or notification to notify CenturyLink of any deficiency (\"Acceptance Period\"). Such notice shall include a written description that specifically demonstrates the deficiency in Service to the reasonable satisfaction of CenturyLink. The Service shall be deemed accepted unless Customer provides CenturyLink with notice to the contrary during the Acceptance Period. Upon timely notice to CenturyLink of a deficiency, CenturyLink will remedy the Service deficiency and provide Customer notification of such remedy at which time a new Acceptance Period shall begin, and CenturyLink will delay billing until accepted in accordance with this provision. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, if CenturyLink partially installs or activates a Service, CenturyLink reserves the right to commence billing for such Service on a pro rata basis. 4. Compliance and Security. Each party shall comply with all laws and regulations applicable to the provision (in the case of CenturyLink) and use (in the case of Customer) of the Services provided hereunder. CenturyLink has adopted and implemented, and shall maintain throughout the Term, a corporate information security program designed to comply with applicable laws and protect Customer’s information, materials and data (\"Customer Data\") from loss, misuse and unauthorized access or disclosure. Such program includes annual employee security awareness training and formal information security policies and\/or procedures. The CenturyLink information security program is subject to reasonable changes by CenturyLink from time to time. Customer will ensure that all Customer Data stored or transmitted via the Service complies with all applicable laws and reasonable information security practices, including without limitation those relating to the encryption of data. As of the Effective Date, CenturyLink has completed an AICPA sanctioned Type II audit report (i.e., SSAE16\/ISAE3402 SOC 1 or AT-101 SOC 2) in certain data centers and intends to continue to conduct such audits pursuant to a currently sanctioned or successor standard. Customer will be entitled to receive a copy of the then- available report, which is CenturyLink Confidential Information. Customer may make such report available to its End Users subject to confidentiality terms provided by CenturyLink.

Customer and its End Users will not use or access the Services or any data center in a manner that materially interferes with or harms the CenturyLink infrastructure or any third parties; or is tortious or violates any third party right. CenturyLink may suspend the affected Service in the event Customer violates the preceding sentence. CenturyLink will attempt to notify Customer in writing prior to suspending Service; provided, however, CenturyLink may suspend Service without notice if CenturyLink becomes aware of a violation of any applicable law or regulation or of activity that exposes CenturyLink to criminal or civil liability or that exposes the CenturyLink network, CenturyLink property or CenturyLink customers' network or property to harm as identified in the CenturyLink TS AUP. Customer agrees to defend, indemnify and hold CenturyLink harmless from third party claims, losses, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees arising from non-compliance with this section. 6. Termination. Either party may terminate this Service Exhibit or affected Services (i) upon 30 days’ prior written notice for Cause; or (ii) in accordance with any other express term contained in the Agreement. If Customer terminates an ordered Service prior to its BCD, Customer will pay a Cancellation Charge equal to one month's projected MRC, plus all out-of-pocket costs incurred by or imposed upon CenturyLink (e.g., ordered equipment, licenses, carrier termination charges). If the Service or this Agreement is terminated either by CenturyLink for Cause or by Customer for Convenience prior to the conclusion of the applicable Service Term, then Customer shall be liable for a Cancellation Charge equal to: (a) unless otherwise set forth on a Service Order, 50% of the then current MRC for the affected Services multiplied by the number of months remaining in the Service Term; (b) Service charges accrued but unpaid as of the termination date; (c) any NRC discount or waiver granted by CenturyLink, and (d) any out-of-pocket costs incurred by or imposed upon CenturyLink (e.g., ordered equipment, licenses, carrier termination charges). If a particular Service is terminated upon which another service is dependent, all such dependent services shall be deemed to be terminated as well. 7. Intellectual Property. Nothing in the Agreement or the performance thereof shall convey, license, or otherwise transfer any right, title, or interest in any intellectual property or other proprietary rights held by either party or its licensors. CenturyLink's intellectual property and proprietary rights include any skills, know-how, modifications or other enhancements developed or acquired in the course of configuring, providing, or managing the Service. Each party agrees that it will not, directly or indirectly, reverse engineer, decompile, reproduce or otherwise attempt to derive source code, trade secrets, or other intellectual property from any information, material, or technology of the other party or its licensors. 8. Equipment. If the Service includes access to or the use of CenturyLink-provided equipment (\"CenturyLink Equipment\"), Customer: (a) will not assert any ownership interest whatsoever in the CenturyLink Equipment; (b) will keep the CenturyLink Equipment free and clear from all liens, claims and encumbrances; (c) shall protect and use all CenturyLink Equipment in accordance with the Agreement; and (d) will cooperate with CenturyLink to allow installation, maintenance and, upon termination, removal of the CenturyLink Equipment. Unless otherwise set forth in the applicable SG or Service Order, Customer is responsible for selecting, supplying, installing and maintaining any equipment used in connection with the Service and not provided by CenturyLink (\"Customer Equipment\") including any related applications, systems, or software. 9. No Transfer of Undertakings. CenturyLink and Customer agree that the provision and subsequent expiry, cancellation or termination of the Services are not intended to be transfers of undertakings within the meaning of the Transfer of Undertaking (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 and related legislation (\"TUPE\"), and consequently there will be no transfer of employees between Customer and CenturyLink (or any other subsequent service provider of Customer) as a result of the operation of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the above, Customer shall indemnify and hold CenturyLink harmless for any losses, claims, liabilities, awards, damages, costs and expenses (including any fines, legal expenses and costs of settlement) CenturyLink may incur through the operation of TUPE in connection with this Agreement. This provision applies only to Services delivered by CenturyLink in the United Kingdom. 10. Maintenance. Customer acknowledges that the Services may be subject to routine maintenance or repair and agrees to cooperate in a timely manner and provide reasonable access and assistance as necessary to allow such maintenance or repair. 11.

Definitions. “Centurylink Premises” means any CenturyLink data center or other CenturyLink facility. “Customer Area” means the space within a CenturyLink Premises specifically identified as available to Customer for the placement and operation of Customer Equipment. 2. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, CenturyLink may increase the rates associated with existing Colocation Service at any time after twelve months of the initial installation date for such Service in order to pass through increases in such Service's underlying power facility costs and such increase shall be effective upon the date set forth in CenturyLink's written notice thereof to Customer. 3. Customer or Customer's employees, agents, contractors, or End Users who access any CenturyLink Premises on Customer's behalf (\"Authorized Representatives\") must be designated in writing. Customer, its Authorized Representatives and all Customer Equipment and any related materials used in connection with the Service shall comply with all CenturyLink data center operating policies (including the \"CenturyLink TS Customer Handbook and Information Guide\" (\"Customer Guide\")), a current copy of which is located on http:\/\/www.savvisstation.com and which CenturyLink may change from time to time. If CenturyLink reasonably believes that Customer is not complying with this section, CenturyLink will notify Customer thereof and Customer shall remedy such non-compliance within 5 days of receiving such notice. If Customer fails to remedy such non-compliance within such period, then, notwithstanding any other rights in the Agreement, CenturyLink may immediately (i) suspend the Service and\/or restrict Customer's access to the CenturyLink Premises for so long as deemed reasonably necessary by CenturyLink or (ii) terminate the affected Service if suc h non¬ compliance is recurring. CenturyLink may likewise restrict access to the CenturyLink Premises if Customer fails to timely cure any breach of the Agreement. 4. Subject to the rest of this section, CenturyLink may enter the Customer Area and\/or access Customer Equipment only to the extent necessary to provide a Service or otherwise exercise its rights under the Agreement. If Customer Equipment needs to be moved to another area within the same CenturyLink Premises or to another CenturyLink Premises due to either Customer's requirements for additional space or CenturyLink's reasonable business needs, the parties will cooperate to complete and minimize the impact of the relocation. CenturyLink may temporarily store Customer Equipment pending its installation at a CenturyLink Premises (\"Equipment Storage\"). If Equipment Storage continues for more than 30 days, CenturyLink may return, at Customer's expense, the Customer Equipment. The risk of loss or damage for any Customer Equipment during any Equipment Storage shall be upon Customer. If any Authorized Representative or Customer Equipment presents any material risk of harm to CenturyLink, its employees, agents, contractors, or customers, or the CenturyLink Premises, Customer shall take prompt action to eliminate such risk. If Customer fails to do so or if there is risk of material and imminent harm, CenturyLink may, without prior notice or liability to Customer, take appropriate action itself, including accessing the Customer Area. Customer, its Authorized Representatives and Customer Equipment will not cause personal injury or property damage at a CenturyLink Premise. 5. Customer shall within five days of the end of the Service Term: (a) remove all Customer Equipment and any other Customer property (\"Customer Materials\") from the CenturyLink Premises; and (b) return the Customer Area to CenturyLink in the same condition as it was on the BCD, normal wear and tear excepted. If Customer fails to remove the Customer Materials within such period or if Customer has an outstanding balance at the end of the Service Term, CenturyLink may remove any Customer Materials (without liability) and, at Customer’s expense, either: (a) store it until Customer remits all amounts owed (including storage expenses) or (b) ship such Customer Materials FOB Origin to Customer at Customer's last address of record. 6. Network Connectivity. 6.1 Hosting Network Infrastructure. The Colocation network infrastructure provides connectivity from Customer’s environments to the available networks within each facility, including the CenturyLink backbone(s), and other Colocation customers or Alternate Carrier Network Connections. With valid orders, Customer is permitted to interconnect to other customers or alternate carriers as described; however, all connections from Customer environment to any other customer or any network infrastructure must be performed by CenturyLink. 6.1.1 Alternate Carrier Network Connection. An Alternate Carrier Network Connection is a connection to a non-CenturyLink network. Depending on the particular data center’s configuration, Alternate Carrier Network Connections can be made at either the data center’s carriers’ premises or at the data center’s servicing point of presence. Depending on the data center and alternate carrier availability, the rates and required components may vary. In the event that a carrier of interest to Customer is not available at the data center’s carriers’ premises Customer is encouraged to inform its CenturyLink sales representative or the data center manager so that CenturyLink may inform such carrier of potential demand for carrier’s services which may lead to a CenturyLink agreement with such carrier to establish a presence at the data center. 7. This is a service agreement and does not constitute a lease of any real property or create any tenant or other real property rights. Customer has been granted only a license to occupy the Customer Area and use the CenturyLink Premises and any CenturyLink Equipment in accordance with the Agreement and agrees that this Service Schedule, to the extent it involves the use of N151141amends Q678470: Contract Code: 191001 Page 4 of 8 CONFIDENTIAL © CenturyLink, Inc.

If the CenturyLink Premises becomes the subject of a taking by eminent domain by any authority having such power, CenturyLink shall have the right to terminate any or all of the affected Services without liability; provided, however, that CenturyLink will use commercially reasonable efforts to move Customer to another, comparable CenturyLink Premises prior to exercising such termination right. CenturyLink shall have the right to terminate any or all of the Services without liability of any kind on the earlier of (i) the expiration of or earlier termination of CenturyLink's underlying lease for the CenturyLink Premises, or (ii) expiration or earlier termination of this Service Schedule. The parties agree that any renewal of the Services shall be contingent on the election by CenturyLink, in its sole discretion, to continue to own or lease the CenturyLink Premises. 8. Insurance. As a condition to providing Customer with physical access to the data centers and\/or the placement of Customer Equipment within the data center, Customer will at all times during the term of this Agreement, and at its own cost and expense, carry and maintain the following insurance coverage with insurers having a minimum “Best’s” rating of A VII (A-7), provided however, if local and\/or regional laws stipulate higher values than those defined herein, then Customer must comply with the applicable higher value as required by law: (a) “All Risk” Property insurance covering all Customer Equipment located in the CenturyLink Premises in an amount not less than its full replacement cost; (b) Commercial General Liability insurance covering claims for bodily injury, death, personal injury, or property damage (including loss of use) occurring or arising out of the license, use or occupancy of the data center by Customer, including coverage for premises- operation, products\/completed operations, and contractual liability with respect to the liability assumed by Customer hereunder.

Upon written request from CenturyLink, Customer will forward to CenturyLink certificate(s) of such insurance. The certificate(s) will provide that: (e ) CenturyLink (and its participating affiliates) be named as additional insured as their interest may appear with respect to this Agreement; and (f) coverage is primary and not excess of, or contributory with, any other valid and collectible insurance purchased or maintained by CenturyLink.

Customer acknowledges that the Services endeavor to mitigate security incidents, but such incidents may not be mitigated entirely or rendered harmless. Each Service is subject to limitations in its scope or performance, as may be more fully set forth in the applicable SG. Security services already provided by CenturyLink under a separate Service Exhibit are governed solely by the terms of such Service Exhibit. 2. Customer should consider any particular Service as just one tool to be used as part of an overall security strategy and not a guarantee of security. 3. Non-standard installations (as identified by CenturyLink in its reasonable opinion), may require extended provisioning intervals and\/or additional costs. 4. Customer shall submit a sufficiently detailed description of any test plan to CenturyLink in advance. The test plan must adhere to any applicable testing standards or procedures provided by CenturyLink. CenturyLink may modify the test plan in its reasonable discretion and may require the execution of additional contractual documents prior to testing. CenturyLink will not respond to any security-related alarms during a scheduled testing period. CenturyLink will have no responsibility whatsoever for any loss or outages during a Customer test, including any otherwise available service credits. Customer agrees that neither it nor its agents will engage in any destructive or otherwise harmful testing. 5. Customer represents that Customer is not (a) located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any country or territory to which export is prohibited under the laws of any country in which CenturyLink operates, or (b) on the U.S. Treasury Department List of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Commerce Department's Table of Deny Orders.

CenturyLink Equipment. If any CenturyLink Equipment will be located at a Customer premises or other non-CenturyLink location or facility (“Customer Site”), Customer agrees: (a) that it has and shall maintain all rights, authorizations and consents necessary to enable CenturyLink to install, operate and maintain the CenturyLink Equipment and Services at the Customer Sites; (b) that it shall, at its expense, provide secure, suitable space and environmental conditions, including power supply, at the Customer Sites as necessary for the installation, operation and maintenance of the CenturyLink Equipment and Service; (c) that it shall not, and shall not permit others to, move, configure, tamper with, modify, restrict access to, or attempt to repair the Services, CenturyLin k Equipment or network or interfere with the maintenance thereof; (d) that it bears the entire risk of loss, theft, destruction, or damage to the CenturyLink Equipment at Customer Sites, not otherwise caused by the negligent acts of CenturyLink. 2. Local Access. If local access is ordered in connection with the Service, CenturyLink will order and administer such local access on Customer's behalf from the local access provider of CenturyLink's choice. CenturyLink reserves the right to change the local access provider in its sole and reasonable discretion. If Customer acquires its own local access for use with the Service, Customer is solely responsible for coordination of all such local access and for any costs (including early termination fees) associated with such local access. Local access will extend to the termination point of the local loop at the applicable Service Address (“Termination Point”) but will not include Customer Equipment, Extended Wiring, inside wiring, or other equipment not maintained by CenturyLink at a Service Address. Any additional provisions required to connect the Termination Point to the Demarcation Point are the sole responsibility of Customer. Customer is responsible for any Construction Charges and Extended Wiring Charges, as defined below. 3. Definitions. \"Construction Charges\" means costs and other expenses that CenturyLink may incur in constructing facilities to extend Service to a Demarcation Point not covered by Extended Wiring, or other activities that may cause CenturyLink to incur expenses in connection with provisioning the Service (e.g., special arrangements of LEC facilities or equipment required to activate the Service). “Demarcation Point” means the physical interface between the Service and Customer’s telecommunications equipment. “Extended Wiring” means additional wiring required to be installed at a Service Address where Customer requests a Demarcation Point beyond the existing Termination Point of the local loop at the Service Address. “Extended Wiring Charges” means costs and other expenses that CenturyLink may incur in connection with Extended Wiring. “Service Address” means the building where Customer receives the Service.

Services. Customer may purchase the products and services (“Services”) in the service exhibits (“Service Exhibits”) attached to the Agreement. The Service Exhibits attached to the Agreement as of the Effective Date and incorporated by this reference are shown below. For an interim period of time until all work is completed to update the Service Exhibits, Tariffs and other terms and conditions incorporated by attachment or reference into this Agreement, all references to Qwest Communications Company, LLC mean CenturyLink Communications, LLC.

Centurylink QC may be required to submit this Agreement, Service Exhibits, Pricing Attachments, and any subsequent addenda for Service to certain regulatory agencies for approval because the Rates or certain other terms are being offered on an individual case basis (“ICB”). Although the general terms and conditions of this Agreement are effective on the Agreement Effective Date, those service-specific Rates and\/or terms, and conditions that require filing with or approval by regulatory agencies (“ICB Terms”) will not become effective for a given jurisdiction until the filing and approval requirements for that jurisdiction are fulfilled. Service will be offered in accordance with the applicable Tariff until the ICB terms become effective. If Customer receives reduced pricing under a Pricing Attachment and a regulatory agency later invalidates the ICB Terms after they became effective, Customer will pay Centurylink QC any difference in the amounts listed in the applicable Tariff for the Service and the amounts Customer was charged for the Service. When approved by the regulatory agencies, Customer may add additional quantities of Services under the same terms and conditions with no further filing required. In the event a regulatory agency does not approve the ICB Terms, the parties will enter into good faith negotiations to mutually resolve the failure to receive the necessary approval. The subject Service Exhibit, Pricing Attachment and subsequent addenda containing the ICB Terms will remain in effect in all other jurisdictions. Each Service Exhibit or subsequent addenda will explain which Rates or terms are ICB. 3. Term; Commitment. Customer's \"Initial Term\" and \"Revenue Commitment\" for the applicable Annual Period will be as follows: Initial Term: 36 Months\n\nAnnual Period (Code:191003) Revenue Commitment\nOne $1,500,000\/year\nTwo $1,800,000\/year\nThree $1,800,000\/year\nNSP #: 120355 Contract Code: 191003 Page 3 of 129 CONFIDENTIAL © CenturyLink, Inc.

At the end of the Initial Term, Vantiv may renew the agreement for up to 3 separate 1 year terms by providing CenturyLink QCC written notice of their intent to renew. If CenturyLink QCC has not received notice such notice by 180 days prior to the then current term, CenturyLink QCC shall notify Customer in writing of such lack of notice. If neither party provides notice the Agreement will renew on a month to month basis. CenturyLink may discontinue the application of all discounts and\/or change the Net Rates for Services to month to month or standard rates at any time during a month to month termTerm. The Initial Term and each Renewal Term are referred to as the “Term.” 4. Contributory Charges. Customer is not obligated to order any particular Service; however, starting three months after the Effective Date, all charges paid by Customer (excluding taxes, third party charges and all regulatory fees) will be applicable to the Revenue Commitment “Contributory Charges”. If Customer fails to meet its Revenue Commitment, Customer must pay the amount of the difference between their aggregate Contributory Charges and the Revenue Commitment as “Shortfall Charge”. If Customer terminates a Service that counts toward Customer’s Contributory Charges pursuant to an express termination right in an SLA or for an Unexpected Event described in this Agreement, Service Exhibit or a separate agreement for such Service, then CenturyLink will deduct that amount from the Revenue Commitment. 5. Rates. Unless specified otherwise in a Service Exhibit, CenturyLink QCC Services will receive the applicable rates specified in a Service Exhibit, valid Order Form, or CenturyLink-approved quote form, for the duration of the Term. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, CenturyLink reserves the right to modify rates and charges due to Regulatory Activity and will provide as much prior written notice as practicable but not less than 14 calendar days’ notice. The parties agree that the rates set forth in the Service Exhibit are in lieu of all other rates, discounts, or promotions. The rates for any CenturyLink QC Service provided will be those in effect at the time the Service is installed and CenturyLink QC Services will renew at the rate and for the term specified in the applicable Tariff, ISG, or Service Exhibit. 6. Payment. CenturyLink may begin invoicing for specific Services as specified in the applicable Service Exhibit. Customer must pay CenturyLink all charges within 45 days after the invoice date or by the due date on the invoice if specified. Any amount not paid when due is subject to late interest at the lesser of 1.5% per month or the maximum rate allowed by law. In addition to payment of charges for Services, Customer must also pay CenturyLink any applicable Taxes assessed in connection with Services. Taxes may vary and are subject to change. Customer may access its invoices and choose paperless invoices online through CenturyLink Control Center located at controlcenter.centurylink.com. Customer’s payments to CenturyLink must be in the form of electronic funds transfer (via wire transfer or ACH), cash payments (via previously-approved CenturyLink processes only), or paper check. CenturyLink reserves the right to charge administrative fees when Customer’s payment preferences deviate from CenturyLink’s standard practices. 7. Confidentiality. Neither CenturyLink nor Customer will, without the prior written consent of the other party: (a) disclose any of the terms of the Agreement; or (b) disclose or use (except as expressly permitted by, or required to achieve the purposes of, the Agreement) the Confidential Information of the other party. Each party will use reasonable efforts to protect the other’s Confidential Information, and will use at least the same efforts to protect such Confidential Information as the party would use to protect its own. CenturyLink’s consent may only be given by its Legal Department. A party may disclose Confidential Information if required to do so by a governmental agency, by operation of law, or if necessary in any proceeding to establish rights or obligations under the Agreement. CenturyLink will not be deemed to have accessed, received, or be in the possession of Customer Confidential Information solely by virtue of the fact that Customer transmits, receives, accesses or stores such information through its use of CenturyLink's Services 8. CPNI. CenturyLink is required by law to treat CPNI confidentially, and CenturyLink will not use Customer’s CPNI for marketing purposes. 9. Use of Name and Marks. Neither party will use the name or marks of the other party or any of its Affiliates for any purpose without the other party’s prior written consent. Either parties consent may only be given by its Legal Department. 10. Disclaimer of Warranties. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THE AGREEMENT, ALL SERVICES AND PRODUCTS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS.” CENTURYLINK DISCLAIMS ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ALL WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. CENTURYLINK MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS THAT ANY SERVICE WILL BE FREE FROM LOSS OR LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF HACKING OR SIMILAR MALICIOUS ACTIVITY, OR ANY ACT OR OMISSION OF THE CUSTOMER. 11.

CenturyLink will not have any obligation under this Section if a claim arises from: (a) the combination, use or operation of any Services with any third party service or product not approved in writing by CenturyLink, (b) any modification of the Services made by any party other than CenturyLink or approved in writing by CenturyLink, (c) use by Customer other than the then current, unaltered release of any software used in the Services, (d) use or operation by Customer or its agents or contractors of the Service other than in accordance with this Agreement and all written instructions and documentation provided by CenturyLink, (e) services for which Customer controlled the design of such services or (f) Customer supplied content, data, or other information.

Cause to terminate an individual Service Exhibit will not necessarily constitute Cause to terminate the Agreement; rather, Cause to terminate the entire Agreement for Service-related claims will exist if Customer has Cause to terminate all or substantially all of the Services under the applicable SLA, Service Exhibit, RSS, ISG, or Tariff. If the Agreement is terminated by Customer for Convenience, prior to meeting its Revenue Commitment or by CenturyLink for Cause prior to the conclusion of the Term, then Customer will pay remaining Early TerminationCharges: (c) for CenturyLink QCC Services, the higher of the Early Termination Charge or the sum of all CenturyLink QCC Cancellation Charges that apply for terminating all CenturyLink QCC Services that have not completed their respective minimum service periods at the time this Agreement is terminated; and (d) for CenturyLink QC Services, the CenturyLink QC termination charges as set forth in the Tariff or the applicable Service Exhibit(s). 14.3 Unpaid Charges. Customer will remain liable for charges accrued but unpaid as of the termination date. 14.4 Transition Services. If CenturyLink terminates the agreement without Cause or Customer terminates the resulting agreement for Cause, CenturyLink will work with Customer to develop and implement a commercially reasonable wind-down and transition plan (“Transition Period”). CenturyLink will agree to continue to provide Service on a month to month basis through such Transition Period (as mutually agreed upon between the parties) for Service installed or ordered prior to the date of CenturyLink’s notice of termination. Notwithstanding the above, the Transition Period and the pricing for the commercial services proposed does not include any custom engineering support. The terms related to custom engineering would need to be addressed under a separate agreement for professional services between the parties. 15. Unexpected Event. 15.1 CenturyLink QCC and Customer acknowledge the possibility that an Unexpected Event (as defined below) may occur during the Term of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, an “Unexpected Event” means an unforeseen event results in a reduction of Customer’s total Contributory Charges incurred by Customer under this Agreement. An “Unexpected Event” will be limited to the following events: (a) a substantial decrease in demand for Customer’s products or service beyond the Customer’s control that significantly reduces the size or scope of Customer’s operations and the volume of CenturyLink Services required by Customer, with the result that Customer is unable to maintain its current volume of CenturyLink QCC Service under this Agreement (“Business Downturn”); (b) the sale or divestiture by Customer of a subsidiary, affiliate or significant operating unit that uses the Services hereunder to an unaffiliated third party and Customer is unable to assign the displaced Services to such successor despite its best efforts (“Business Divestiture”); (c) the introduction by CenturyLink QCC of a new service that is based on substantially new technology that was unavailable as of the Effective Date and that materially improves Customer’s current Services and\/or applications by affording more efficient communication through an increase in the speed and\/or capacity of such communication or Service and thereby decreased demand for Customer’s existing Service (“New Technology”); (d) CenturyLink’s failure, refusal or inability to provide service(s) or CenturyLink’s discontinuance of service(s) according to the terms and conditions of the Agreement. (e) The procurement of services by Vantiv from another supplier in order to secure physical route diversity for Tail Circuits provided only if CenturyLink cannot provide such services. For any of these Unexpected Events, the Revenue Commitment will be automatically reduced by an amount equal to ’’Shortfall Reduction Amount”. 15.2 Customer must promptly notify CenturyLink upon the occurrence of any Unexpected Event. Following the receipt of notice and confirmation by CenturyLink QCC of the conditions giving rise to the application of this provision, CenturyLink QCC will either: (a) deduct the Shortfall Reduction Amount from any Shortfall charge incurred after the Unexpected Event or (b) meet with Customer in order to develop another mutually agreeable solution, including, but not limited to, revised pricing, discounts, revenue commitment, term length, or other terms based on Customer’s revised, actual Contributory Charges. This provision does not constitute a waiver of any charges incurred by Customer prior to the time the parties mutually agree to amend or supersede this Agreement. 16. Insurance. CenturyLink will obtain and maintain, at its expense, insurance coverage in the following coverage categories and amounts with an insurance carrier that has a minimum A.M. Best Rating of A-VII: (i) Statutory Workers' Compensation Insurance and Employers' Liability Insurance in the minimum amount of $1,000,000 each employee by accident, $1,000,000 each employee by disease, and $1,000,000 aggregate by disease, with benefits afforded under the laws of the state in which the services are to be performed.

CenturyLink is to provide a waiver in subrogation in favor of Vantiv on all of the above¬ referenced policies, for losses caused by and to the extent of CenturyLink’s negligence. Under this Agreement. 17. Miscellaneous. 17.1 General. The Agreement’s benefits do not extend to any third party (e.g., an End User). If any term of the Agreement is held unenforceable, the remaining terms will remain in effect.

The SLA provides Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy for service interruptions or service deficiencies of any kind whatsoever for the Service. worldcard offers domestic calling card services available either interstate or intrastate and is available through switched access only. worldcard is offered with three options: (c) the standard option includes CenturyLink’s trademarks and telephone number; (d) the “cologo” option includes CenturyLink’s and Customer’s names and trademarks and\/or logos and will include either CenturyLink’s or Customer’s telephone number; and (e) the “private label” option only includes Customer’s names trademarks and\/or logos and will include either CenturyLink’s or Customer’s telephone number. If Customer selects the cologo or private label worldcard options, then Customer grants CenturyLink permission to create a card using Customer’s name, trademarks and\/or logos as provided to CenturyLink by Customer. Customer further agrees that even though Customer’s name, trademarks, logo and\/or phone number may appear on the cards, except for Customer’s rights in its name, trademarks, and\/or logo, CenturyLink will be sole owner of all right and title in and to all intellectual property associated with the cards and the worldcard service. Furthermore, if Customer selects either the cologo or private label cards, then Customer agrees to indemnify and hold CenturyLink harmless for any costs, fees, damages, or expenses of any sort incurred by CenturyLink as a result of claims arising from CenturyLink’s use of Customer’s name, trademarks or logo in accordance with this Agreement. In addition to the other worldcard charges listed in the Pricing Attachment, Customer will pay to CenturyLink any set-up charges associated with the design and production of the cologo and private label cards. CenturyLink will notify Customer of the total amount of set-up charges prior to production of the cards. If Customer objects to the set-up charges, then the parties will work together to create a less expensive design than originally requested by Customer (this sentence and the previous sentence combined constitute the “Set-up Process”). If Customer revokes the use of its mark for the cologo or private label cards or requests new cards due to its mark changing, then Customer must cease using those cards and CenturyLink will issue replacement cards that either do not include Customer’s mark or contain the new mark, as appropriate. The Set-up Process will apply to the replacement cards and Customer will pay CenturyLink the set-up charges for the replacement cards. The person(s) named on the calling card and those identified on CenturyLink’s records for the associated account are jointly and severally responsible for the charges made using the calling card. The calling card is not transferable, but the cardholder may authorize others to use it. The cardholder is responsible for all charges incurred by authorized users, and giving the calling card to someone else or telling someone else the security code is such authorization. The calling card will be cancelled at the cardholder’s request. CenturyLink may cancel the calling card if the cardholder cancels or fails to pay, if CenturyLink suspects fraud, improper, or unauthorized use or observes unusual use, or if it changes its policies for issuing worldcard calling cards. CenturyLink may cancel the calling card without notice. CenturyLink is not liable for any damages for any reason due to the cancellation of, or failure to accept the calling card. If a calling card is canceled for any reason, the cardholder must notify all authorized users and destroy all calling cards. The cardholder should notify CenturyLink immediately if the cardholder changes address or telephone number or if a calling card is lost, stolen, or misplaced or if a cardholder suspects unauthorized use or misuse of a calling card. To report a loss, theft, or suspected misuse, please call 1 800-860-1020. Some uses of the worldcard calling card may be subject to rules, regulations, and tariffs of state public utility commissions and the Federal Communications Commission. 2.2 Domestic IP Voice. Domestic IP Voice Service consists of IP intrastate and interstate dedicated Long Distance and IP dedicated Toll Free. Domestic IP Voice accepts intrastate and interstate dedicated Long Distance traffic in IP format and converts such traffic for transmission across the telecommunications network. Domestic IP Voice also accepts domestic Toll Free traffic and converts it into VoIP format for transmission to Customer. The pricing for Domestic IP Voice services is the same as for non-IP intrastate and interstate dedicated Long Distance and non-IP dedicated Toll Free. Domestic IP Voice does not support local services, 911, E911, V911, operator services, local number portability, or directory listings. All use of Domestic IP Voice will comply with and be subject to the service guide, AUP, and applicable sections of the SLA which are posted at http:\/\/www.qwest.centurylink.com\/legal\/.

The service guide and AUP are incorporated into the Agreement by this reference. CenturyLink may reasonably modify the service guide, AUP, and SLA to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations and to protect CenturyLink's network and customers, and such change will be effective upon posting to the Web site. 2.3 CenturyLink 8XX Outbound Service. CenturyLink 8XX Outbound Service (“8XX Outbound”) allows Customer to place Toll Free Outbound TDM or IP calls to CenturyLink owned or non-CenturyLink owned Toll Free numbers on Customer’s CenturyLink dedicated access lines (“DALS”). 8XX Outbound is only available on DALs provisioned on CenturyLink DMS250, NGS, and IPLD switched. 8XX Outbound is not subject to an SLA. 8XX Outbound is governed by the CenturyLink RSS and\/or Tariffs. CenturyLink reserves the right, upon 30 calendar days prior written notice to Customer, to cancel or modify 8XX Outbound. If Customer does not agree to the 8XX Outbound modifications, then Customer must notify CenturyLink prior to the expiration of the 30 day time frame that Customer wishes to cancel 8XX Outbound. Customer’s continued use of 8XX Outbound after the 30-day time frame will indicate that Customer agrees to the modifications. Limitations. CenturyLink provides 8XX Outbound by routing and terminating the toll-free call to a CenturyLink dedicated facility that is connected to a lEc facility to allow re-origination to the dialed toll-free number. CenturyLink is only responsible for getting the call to the LEC for re-origination. CenturyLink cannot provide any kind of support or help troubleshoot problems with Toll Free origination or termination once the call is delivered to the LEC for re-origination. Because all outbound Toll Free calls will re¬ originate from a LEC central office, the outbound toll-free call will route as if the call originates from the LEC central office, and not from the geographic location of Customer’s DAL. If there is regional (i.e., calls only allowed to originate from specific states or disallowed from specific states) or point of call (geographic) routing on the dialed toll-free number, the call may not be completed. From time to time CenturyLink may add, change, and\/or remove the central offices from which calls are re-originated, without notice to Customer. Customer requests for 8XX Outbound changes or additions, including additional 8XX Outbound traffic volumes, are subject to availability and CenturyLink’s acceptance of the order. 2.4 Non-Completed Calls. “Non-completed Call Percentage Threshold\" means 30% of all attempted calls, both completed and non¬ completed. If the percentage of Customer’s calls that do not complete (out of all attempted calls) meets or exceeds the Non -completed Call Percentage Threshold for any given monthly billing cycle, CenturyLink may, upon 30 calendar days notice to Customer, disconnect any and all circuit(s) providing Service on which the Non-completed Call Percentage Threshold was exceeded. 3. Term. This Service Exhibit will expire or terminate coterminous with the Agreement, unless terminated earlier by either party by providing 60 days advance written notice. 4. Charges. As applicable, Customer will pay the rates, Net Rates, Net Effective Rates, and all other charges set forth in the Pricing Attachment, RSS, Tariff, ISS, or Order Form. Customer is responsible for all metered usage charges and per call charges that occur from the point Service is available for Customer use, regardless of whether CenturyLink notifies Customer of Service availability. Domestic Long Distance calls crossing state boundaries, within the same LATA, will be billed at the interstate rate. The rates, Net Rates, and Net Effective Rates do not include costs associated with local access or CPE, which rates are described in the Service Exhibits specific to those services or in a separate agreement for such service. Customer's 8XX Outbound will bill the same rates as Customer's dedicated outbound Long Distance (1+). Customer understands and agrees that all 8XX Outbound calls will be billed to the trunk group owner, even if the dialed toll-free numbers belong to CenturyLink. CenturyLink reserves the right, upon 30 calendar days prior written notice to Customer, to charge an MRC for 8XX Outbound. If Customer does not agree to the MRC, then Customer must notify CenturyLink prior to the expiration of the 30 day time frame that Customer wishes to cancel 8XX Outbound. Customer’s continued use of 8Xx Outbound after the 30-day time frame will indicate that Customer agrees to pay the MRC. Unless a Net Rate or Net Effective Rate is specified in the Pricing Attachment, domestic Outbound Long Distance and 8XX Outbound, domestic Toll Free (including any features), domestic VNS, and domestic worldcard voice services will be charged at the Agreement rates in the Tariff, ISS, and RSS. Rates and Net Rates will be used for calculating Contributory Charges. Customer represents that it has received from a CenturyLink competitor an offer comparable to the offer in this Service Exhibit for the Services.

Domestic Service with a CenturyLink provided router includes 8x5 NBD maintenance using Pro-MET® Remote Standard Service or 24x7 on-site maintenance using Pro-MET® On-Site Premium Service at Customer qualified sites. CenturyLink may use repackaged Rental CPE or substitute the Rental CPE with other CPE. Customer is responsible for any trouble shooting and repair of equipment on Customer’s side of the router. Domestically, a CenturyLink IQ + Port is only available in a CenturyLink determined data center. 2.3 Network Management Service. CenturyLink Network Management Service (“NMS”) is a feature available for all Ports except for a CenturyLink IQ + Port using CenturyLink Data Center Access. Select Management or Comprehensive Management is available with domestic Ports. The feature provides performance reporting, change management, configuration management, fault monitoring, management and notification of cPe and network related issues. Except for CenturyLink IQ + Ports, CenturyLink will provide Select Management with each domestic Port unless (a) Customer notifies its CenturyLink sales representative that Customer opts out of Select Management for that Port or (b) Customer chooses Comprehensive Management for that Port, Customer may also request NMS management features for devices not associated with a CenturyLink IQ Networking Port in domestic locations with CenturyLink’s prior approval. The NMS management types are set forth in more detail below. (a) Monitor and Notification. Monitor and Notification is included with CenturyLink IQ + Ports other than for a CenturyLink IQ + Port using CenturyLink Data Center Access and is an optional NMS feature for the other Port types. CenturyLink will monitor the Customer devices 24x7x365 for up\/down status using ICMP ping. CenturyLink will notify Customer if no response is received for a designated period. NMS will not provide any troubleshooting and incident resolution for device or network faults. ’’Monitor & Notification” is the only NMS option available for devices that do not support SNMP and\/or are not certified for NMS. (b) Select Management. Select Management includes 24x7x365 up\/down monitoring as well as 24x7x365 remote performance monitoring, reporting, and ticketing via an NMS online portal for devices supported by CenturyLink, fault monitoring, management, and notification (detection, isolation, diagnosis, escalation and remote repair when possible), change management supported by CenturyLink (up to 12 changes per year), asset management (device inventory), and configuration management (inventory of customer physical and logical configuration). Customer must make change management requests via Control Center at https:\/\/controlcenter.centurylink.com. Select Management only supports basic routing functions. NMS does not include new CPE initial configuration, lab testing, lab modeling, or on-site work of CPE. The NMS supported device list and a standard change management list are available on request and are subject to change without notice. (c) Comprehensive Management. Comprehensive Management includes all of the Select Management features as well as total customer agency and change management (up to 24 configuration changes per year) of complex routing functions within routers, switches, and firewall modules. This includes configuration and management of complex routing, switching, device NIC cards, firewall module configurations, and basic router internal firewall functions. CenturyLink acts as the Customer’s single point of contact in managing the resolution of all service, device, and transport faults covered by Comprehensive Management and will work with any third party hardware and\/or transport providers the Customer has under contract until all network issues are successfully resolved. With Internet security protocol (“IPSec”), CenturyLink can configure full mesh, partial mesh, or hub-and-spoke topologies with secure tunnels for remote communication between Customer locations. IPSec is only available on approved Cisco and Adtran devices. IPSec opportunities greater than 25 devices or with other manufacturer’s devices require CenturyLink approval before submitting an order.

All Rights Reserved. v1.073015 DocuSign Envelope ID: 7105E734-21CC-4511-AE45-FEBD4D3EA099 CENTURYLINK® TOTAL ADVANTAGE® AGREEMENT DOMESTIC CENTURYLINK IQ® NETWORKING SERVICE EXHIBIT (d) CenturyLink Responsibilities. For NMS, CenturyLink will provide Customer with a nonexclusive service engineer team, which will maintain a Customer profile for the portion of the Customer’s network where the devices covered by NMS reside. CenturyLink will work with Customer to facilitate resolution of service affecting issues with Select Management or Comprehensive Management. (e) Customer Responsibilities. (i) Customer must provide all information and perform all actions reasonably requested by CenturyLink in order to facilitate installation of NMS. If Customer limits or restricts CenturyLink’s read\/write access to a device, CenturyLink cannot support configuration backups. Customer is responsible for supporting CenturyLink in access, troubleshooting, and configuration requests made in accordance with normal troubleshooting and repair support activities. For Out-of-Band management related to fault isolation\/resolution, Customer will provide and maintain a POTS line for each managed device. “Out-of-Band” means a connection between two devices that relies on a non-standard network connection, such as an analog dial modem, which must be a CenturyLink certified 56k external modem. Additionally, Customer will provide a dedicated modem for each managed device. It is not mandatory that Customer have a POTS line but Customer must understand that CenturyLink will not be able to troubleshoot issues if the device covered by NMS cannot be reached. Service related outages requiring access to the device for troubleshooting and repair purposes will impact the eligibility of any associated SLA credits. (ii) For Comprehensive Management, Customer must execute the attached Letter of Agency (Attachment 1) to authorize CenturyLink to act as Customer’s agent solely for the purpose of accessing Customer’s transport services. (iii) Depending on transport type, Customer’s managed devices must comply with the following set of access requirements: (A) for NMS delivered via IP connectivity with an Internet Port or other public Internet service, devices must contain an appropriate version of OS capable of establishing IPsec VPNs; and (B) for NMS delivered with a Private Port, CenturyLink will configure a virtual circuit to access Customer’s device at no additional charge. CenturyLink will add the NMS network operations center to the Customer closed user group to manage the devices within Customer’s network. (iv) Customer must provide a routable valid IP address to establish the NMS connection. Customer’s primary technical interface person must be available during the remote installation process to facilitate installation of NMS. All Customer devices managed under NMS must be maintained under a contract from a CenturyLink approved onsite CPE maintenance provider. The response times for which Customer contracts with its CPE maintenance provider will affect CenturyLink’s timing for resolution of problems involving Customer provided devices. The performance of the CPE maintenance provider is Customer’s responsibility. 2.4 End-to-End Performance Reporting. End-to-End Performance Reporting is a feature included with Private Ports, the Private Port functionality of Enhanced Ports and CenturyLink IQ + Ports, except for Ports with VPLS. Customer must include CenturyLink as a member of each closed user group. The feature includes a report based on data collected from Customer’s traffic within its closed user groups and measures availability, jitter, latency, and packet delivery between Customer’s edge routers, between CenturyLink’s routers, and between Customer’s edge routers and CenturyLink’s routers. The data contained in the report is measured differently than the goals contained in the SLA applicable to the Service and is for informational purposes only. Customer is not entitled to SLA credits based on the data in the report. Customer may access the report in the Control Center portal. Some quote forms or other associated documents may use “End-to-End Performance Monitoring” to mean “End-to-End Performance Reporting”. 2.5 Multicast. Multicast is an optional feature for Private Ports and the Private Port functionality of Enhanced Ports. The feature enables IP multicast on the CenturyLink IP network. Customer must configure its edge devices with CenturyLink designated multicast protocol specifications and use the CenturyLink designated IP address range for Customer’s multicast applications. The standard feature allows up to ten sources of multicast traffic per Customer, but CenturyLink may permit a limited number of additional sources. 2.6 Secure IP Gateway. Secure IP Gateway (“SIG”) is an optional feature for Enhanced Ports. SIG adds a network based firewall feature to an Enhanced Port and supports Customer defined network address translation policies and firewall rule sets. 2.7 VPLS. Layer 2 virtual private LAN service (“VPLS”) is optional feature for Private Ports only. Private Ports with VPLS are supported on CenturyLink-certified Cisco equipment and are limited to the following connection and encapsulation methods: Ethernet 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, 1000 Mbps with Ethernet encapsulation; DS1 and DS3 with Frame Relay encapsulation, and OC3 with ATM encapsulation. The following features are not available with Private Ports with VPLS: (a) usage reports; (b) the Precise Burstable or Data Transfer pricing methodologies; (c) the SLA’s Reporting Goal; (d) VPN Extensions and (e) End-to-End Performance Reporting. 2.8 VPN Extensions. A VPN Extension is an optional feature for layer 3 multi protocol label switching (“MPLS”) Private Ports and Enhanced Ports. The feature allows Customer to extend its Layer 3 MPLS closed user groups to Customer locations that are not served by CenturyLink’s MPLS network (“Remote Location”). Customer can establish a tunnel through the Internet between the Customer’s CPE at the Remote Location (separately purchased and managed by Customer) and the CenturyLink network device. The Customer provided CPE must support the CenturyLink service configurations and be installed as designated by CenturyLink or as otherwise agreed upon by the parties. Customer is responsible for the installation, operation, maintenance, use and compatibility of the Remote Location CPE. Customer will cooperate with CenturyLink in setting the initial configuration for the Remote Location CPE interface with the VPN Extension Service. Customer must use IP connectivity at the Remote Location that includes a static public IP address. NSP #: 120355 Contract Code: 191003 Page 22 of 129 CONFIDENTIAL © CenturyLink, Inc. All Rights Reserved. v1.073015 DocuSign Envelope ID: 7105E734-21CC-4511-AE45-FEBD4D3EA099 CENTURYLINK® TOTAL ADVANTAGE® AGREEMENT DOMESTIC CENTURYLINK IQ® NETWORKING SERVICE EXHIBIT (a) Exclusions. CenturyLink will not debug problems on, or configure any internal or external hosts or networks (e.g., routers, DNS servers, mail servers, www servers, and FTP servers). All communication regarding the VPN Extension must be between CenturyLink and a Customer approved site contact that has relevant experience and expertise in Customer’s network operations. The following features are not available with VPN Extensions: (i) End-to-End Performance Reporting; (ii) QoS; (iii) VPLS; and (iv) Multicast. VPN Extensions are not subject to the SLA. 2.9 Backbone Prioritization\/Priority Queuing. Backbone Prioritization and Priority Queuing is an optional feature available with individual domestic Private Ports and CenturyLink IQ + Ports respectively. When this feature is configured on such Port, traffic originating from that Port will be designated at a higher class of service to the CenturyLink IP network than traffic originating from Private Ports or CenturyLink IQ + Ports without the feature or Internet Ports. If Customer desires the feature for traffic between two or more such Ports, the feature must be ordered for each such Port. The benefit from this feature is realized during periods of high network congestion. The feature may not be available at all locations or with Multicast in certain circumstances. 3. Ordering. For purposes of this Service Exhibit, “Order Form” means an electronic order confirmation process using an architecture confirmation document (“ACD”) or other document that Customer and CenturyLink mutually agree to prior to submitting a Service order request. CenturyLink must approve each Order Form and Customer must send it via e-mail, fax, or other CenturyLink- approved electronic process to CenturyLink. Subject to availability, CenturyLink will assign \/29 Internet address space for Customer during the use of a Port. Neither Customer nor any End Users will own or route these addresses. Upon termination of Service, Customer’s access to the IP addresses will cease. If Customer requests special sequencing for Port installation, Customer must designate a Key Port. A “Key Port” is a Port that must be available on the network before adding additional domestic Port locations. The installation of the Key Port will determine the timelines for the installation of other domestic Ports. Customer may designate one Key Port within its CenturyLink IQ Networking network topology by notifying CenturyLink in writing of that request. Unless the parties otherwise agree in writing, Customer has sole responsibility for ordering, securing installation and ensuring proper operation of any and all equipment required to enable Customer to receive the Service. 4. Charges. Customer must pay all applicable MRCs and NRCs set forth in an attached pricing attachment, offer attachment, or a valid signed CenturyLink issued quote. For CenturyLink IQ + Ports only, the rates for the (a) Local Access, (b) Monitor and Notification (if included with a CenturyLink IQ + Port) and (c) optional Rental CPE and Priority Queuing are presented with the Port rates. Charges will commence within five days after the date CenturyLink notifies Customer that Service is provisioned and ready for use (“Start of Service Date”). Customer may order multiple Ports with multiple pricing methodologies in accordance with the pricing methodologies set forth below. Customer may change the pricing methodology (e.g., from Flat Rate to Precise Burstable) of a Port if: (a) the Port’s new MRC remains the same or greater than the old MRC, and (b) the Port starts a new Service Term that is equal to or greater than the remaining number of months in the old Service Term, subject to a 12 month minimum. CenturyLink may change rates after the completion of a Port’s Service Term with 60 days’ notice. The net rate MRCs set forth in the pricing attachment, offer attachment or valid signed CenturyLink issued quote will be used to calculate Contributory Charges. Net rate MRCs are lieu of all other rates, discounts, and promotions. The End-to-End Performance Reporting, VPN Extension, SIG and Multicast features are provided on a month-to-month basis and either party may cancel a feature with 30 days’ prior written notice to the other party. CenturyLink may upon 30 days prior written notice to Customer modify those features, including without limitation, their rates. 4.1 Pricing Methodologies. (a) Flat Rate. The Flat Rate pricing methodology bills Customer a specified MRC for a given Port speed regardless of Customer’s actual bandwidth utilization. (b) Tiered. The Tiered pricing methodology caps Customer’s bandwidth at the tier specified on an Order Form and bills the Customer a fixed MRC based on that bandwidth tier regardless of Customer’s actual bandwidth utilization. No more than once per month, Customer may change its specific bandwidth tier (e.g., 2 Mbps to10 Mbps) within the applicable Port classification (e.g., Ethernet, Fast Ethernet). Customer may not change its bandwidth from one Port classification to another. (c) Precise Burstable. Usage samples are taken every five minutes throughout the monthly billing cycle. Only one sample is captured for each five-minute period, even though there are actually two samples taken; one for inbound utilization and one for outbound utilization. The higher of these two figures is retained. At the end of the billing period, the samples are ordered from highest to lowest. The top 5% of the samples are discarded. The highest remaining sample is used to calculate the usage level, which is the 95th percentile of peak usage. For each Precise Burstable Port, Customer will pay an MRC calculated by multiplying Customer’s 95th percentile of peak usage in a given month by the applicable MRC per Mbps. There is a minimum usage amount within each Precise Burstable Port classification (“Precise Burstable Minimum”). Customer will be billed the greater of the Precise Burstable Minimum or the actual charges based upon its 95th percentile of peak usage. (d) Data Transfer. Usage samples are taken every five minutes throughout the Customer’s monthly billing cycle. Samples are taken for both in-bound utilization and out-bound utilization. Customer will be billed for the sum total of both inbound and outbound utilization. Charges are applied using a stepped or “metered” methodology such that Customer’s traffic will be billed incrementally at each volume tier. For example, if Customer’s total volume on a DS1 circuit is 10 GB, the first 7 GB of such total would be billed at the 0-7 GB tier, and the remaining 3 GB would be billed at the 7.01-17 GB tier. For each Data Transfer Port ordered hereunder, Customer will pay an MRC calculated by multiplying Customer’s volume of data transferred in a given month (in GBs) by the applicable M RC per GB. Within each Data Transfer Port classification (e.g., DS1, DS3), Customer will be subject to the minimum usage amount set forth in the column heading of the applicable Data Transfer pricing table (“Data Transfer Minimum”). Customer will be billed the greater of the NSP #: 120355 Contract Code: 191003 Page 23 of 129 CONFIDENTIAL © CenturyLink, Inc. All Rights Reserved. v1.073015 DocuSign Envelope ID: 7105E734-21CC-4511-AE45-FEBD4D3EA099 CENTURYLINK® TOTAL ADVANTAGE® AGREEMENT DOMESTIC CENTURYLINK IQ® NETWORKING SERVICE EXHIBIT Data Transfer Minimum or the actual charges based upon its actual volume of data transferred. Data Transfer pricing is only available if Customer’s premises-based router uses HDLC, PPP, or MLPPP line encapsulation. 5. Term; Cancellation. 5.1 Term. The term of an individual Port (and associated features\/Services, if applicable) begins on the Start of Service Date for that Port and continues for (a) the service term shown on the valid signed CenturyLink issued quote or the pricing attachment for CenturyLink IQ + Ports or (b), One Year for other domestic Ports (each a “Service Term”). If Service is installed at multiple Customer locations or with multiple Ports at a Customer location, each separate Port (and associated features\/Services) will have its own Start of Service Date. Upon expiration of a Service Term, CenturyLink IQ + Ports and other domestic Ports (and associated features\/Services) will remain in effect on a month-to-month basis until canceled by either party with 60 days’ notice. 5.2 Cancellation. Upon cancellation of a Service, Customer will remain liable for charges accrued but unpaid as of the cancellation date. If a Port and associated features\/Services is canceled by Customer other than for Cause, or by CenturyLink for Cause, before the conclusion of its Service Term or Upgrade Service Term (as described in the “Upgrades” section), Customer will pay a “Cancellation Charge” equal to: (a) Domestic Internet Port, Private Port or Enhanced Ports: (i) 100% of the Port and NMS MRCs multiplied by the number of months remaining in the first 12 months of the initial Service Term (or Upgrade Service Term), if any, plus (ii) 35% of the balance of those MRCs multiplied by the number of months remaining to complete the initial Service Term (or Upgrade Service Term) beyond the first 12 months, plus (iii) the amount of any NRCs discounted or waived if the Port has not remained installed for at least 12 months. (b) CenturyLink IQ + Ports: (i) 100% of the CenturyLink IQ + Port MRC (and associated features\/Service MRCs if applicable) multiplied by the number of months remaining in the first 12 months of the initial Service Term, if any; plus (ii) 75% of the those MRCs multiplied by the number of months remaining to complete 24 months of the initial Service Term, if any; plus, if applicable, (iii) 50% of those MRCs multiplied by the number of months remaining to complete the remainder of the Service Term. 5.3 Waiver of Cancellation Charges. (a) Upgrades. CenturyLink will waive the Cancellation Charges for a domestic Port if Customer: (i) upgrades a Port to another Port with a higher bandwidth (e.g., from a DS1 to a DS3) within the same pricing methodology and the new Port’s MRC (with Local Access) is equal to or greater than the combined MRCs of the Port and the associated Local Access Service being terminated; (ii) upgrades the Port type to a higher Port type (e.g., from an Internet Port to a Private Port or an Enhanced Port) within the same pricing methodology; or (iii) upgrades any Port to a CenturyLink IQ + Port. All upgraded Ports must start a new Service Term equal to or greater than the replaced Port’s remaining Service Term, subject to a 12 month minimum (“Upgrade Service Term”). If Customer cancels the upgraded Port before the completion of the Upgrade Service Term, Customer will pay the Cancellation Charges set forth in the Cancellation section above. In some cases an upgrade to a Port may trigger a Local Access charge under the Local Access Service Exhibit. Customer can upgrade a CenturyLink IQ + Port from 8x5 NBD Remote to 24x7 On-Site maintenance or upgrade a CenturyLink IQ + Port’s NMS feature to Select Management or Comprehensive Management without restarting the Service Term. (b) Migration to Other CenturyLink Services. CenturyLink will waive the Cancellation Charges for a domestic Port if Customer migrates the Port to new Analog VoIP Service or Data Bundle Solutions (a “New Service”) as long as: (i) the New Service’s MRC is equal to or greater than the combined MRCs of the Port and the associated Local Access Service being terminated; (ii) the New Service’s minimum service term is at least as long as the then remaining Service Term of the Port being terminated; and (iii) the New Service is available. 6. Additional Disclaimer of Warranty. In addition to any other disclaimers of warranty stated in the Agreement, CenturyLink makes no warranty, guarantee, or representation, express or implied, that all security threats and vulnerabilities will be detected or that the performance of the Services will render Customer’s systems invulnerable to security breaches.

Capitalized terms not defined herein are defined in the Agreement. CenturyLink QCC will provide SIP Trunk (“SIP Trunk” or “Service”) under the terms of the Agreement and this Service Exhibit. “ANI” means automatic number identification. “Approved Connectivity” means new or existing CenturyLink IQ® Networking. If Customer selects an access type that does not provide guaranteed end-to-end QoS or if Customer is not using Approved Connectivity at any point in time (e.g., a Wi-Fi or wireless network or device), Customer may experience call quality issues. In these instances, CenturyLink’s Voice Availability SLA will not apply. Additionally, Customer acknowledges that the only way to resolve quality issues on connectivity that does not provide end-to-end QoS may be to move to another connectivity type that provides end-to-end QoS. “Calling Party Number” (CPN) means the originating party’s telephone number, as displayed on Caller ID (when Caller ID privacy is not restricted). “CenturyLink-Approved 911 Location” means Customer’s current 911 location that is displayed on the CenturyLink Control Center Business portal (https:\/\/controlcenter.centurylink.com), which may be the 911 location of a customer PPU, or an updated temporary location that CenturyLink has previously approved. Service may only be used at a CenturyLink-Approved 911 Location. “Customer Environment” means Customer’s data network\/equipment and premises environment. “IP” means Internet Protocol. “ISS” means Information Services Schedule which can be found at http:\/\/www.centurylink.com\/tariffs\/qcc info services.pdf and which is subject to change. Unless otherwise provided in the Pricing Attachment, the ISS contains the current rates for domestic and international Off-Net Calls and toll free calls. “Local Session” means a Session used for the origination and termination of local and long distance telephone calls. “MATR” means minimum average time requirement. ”Net Rates” are in lieu of all other rates, discounts, and promotions. “Off-Net Calls” means any calls that are not (a) local calls, (b) 8xx outbound calls, or (c) On-Net Calls. “On-Net Calls” means calls between the Service and any of the following CenturyLink QCC services: SIP Trunk, Managed VoIP, Hosted VoIP, Analog VoIP, Digital VoIP, or Integrated Access, and that are transmitted through the Service entirely over the CenturyLink QCC IP network and not the PSTN or another carrier’s IP network. “Ported Telephone Number” means an existing telephone number that is currently subscribed to a local exchange carrier for local, local toll and\/or long distances telecommunications services and ported to CenturyLink for use with the Service. “PPU” means the location given by the Customer as the Primary Place of Use for a particular TN or 8xx TN. “Pricing Attachment” means a document containing rates specific to the Service and is incorporated by reference and made a part of this Service Exhibit. “PSAP” means public safety answering point. “PSTN” means public switched telephone network. “QoS” means Quality of Service. “Session” means a single unit of simultaneous call capacity. “SIP” means Session Initiation Protocol. “SIP Diversion Header” means a header used to support PSTN redirecting services such as Call Forwarding. “SLA” means the service level agreement specific to the Service, and is attached to the Agreement.“Start of Service Date” means the date CenturyLink notifies Customer that the Service is provisioned and ready for use. “TN” means a telephone number. “Trunk Group” means a group of Sessions used for local or usage-based voice services. “Usage Session” means a Session used for the termination of inbound toll free service. 2. Service. 2.1 Description. Service provides the delivery of origination and termination of local, including 911, voice traffic and optionally long¬ distance, and toll-free traffic via a SIP signaling interface enabled to the Customer Premise Equipment (CPE). All voice traffic will be delivered in an IP format over separately purchased Approved Connectivity. The local and long distance calling service area that applies to a Service location is based on the area code and prefix assigned to the numbers for that location and does not depend on Customer’s physical location. 2.2 Local, 8XX and On-Net Calls. Local calls, 8XX outbound calls, and On-Net calls are included in the Service MRC. Domestic and international Off-Net Calls, business white page listings; and directory assistance are optional services that are available for additional charges described on the Summary Page or in the ISS. 2.3 Optional Services. The following optional services are available for the additional charges shown in the Pricing Attachment or other pricing document identified below. NSP #: 120355 Contract Code: 191003 Page 30 of 129 CONFIDENTIAL © CenturyLink, Inc. All Rights Reserved. v1.073015 DocuSign Envelope ID: 7105E734-21CC-4511-AE45-FEBD4D3EA099 CENTURYLINK® TOTAL ADVANTAGE® AGREEMENT SIP TRUNK SERVICE EXHIBIT (a) Directory Assistance. A flat per call charge applies to directory assistance. (b) IP Diversity. Customer may order more than one CenturyLink IQ Networking port for the purpose of maintaining diverse IP access to the Service. Redundant CenturyLink IQ Networking ports will be purchased separately under the CenturyLink Domestic Network Diversity Service Exhibit for an additional charge. In order for Customer to use CenturyLink IQ Networking port diversity with the Service CenturyLink must configure the Service to make use of the diverse ports. An IP Diversity NRC will apply for such configuration. (c) Directory Listings. An additional MRC applies to each basic business white page listing of a telephone number. (d) Off-Net Long-Distance: Unless otherwise provided in the Pricing Attachment, Off-Net Calls are available at the per minute rates for domestic and international Long Distance service shown in the ISS. Additional per minute charges may apply to each Off-Net Call leg of a conference call. (e) Usage-Based Trunk Groups. Customer may direct long distance calls to a usage-based Trunk Group. Off-Net LD calls directed to a usage-based Trunk Group will incur usage charges, but will not be charged a per Session charge. LD usage-based trunks are not intended to be used for placing local calls, including 911 calls. Since CenturyLink cannot always capture and provide the correct end user location for 911 calls when made over LD usage-based trunks, 911 calls placed over those trunks may not route to the proper PSAP. In those circumstances, CenturyLink may need to route the 911 call to a default national emergency call routing center, and additional third-party charges may apply. If CenturyLink incurs such additional third-party charges, CenturyLink may bill Customer for such charges. Additionally, Customer acknowledges that if it sends local calls down a usage-based Trunk Group, those calls will incur charges at the Off-Net LD rate. To avoid incremental LD charges on local calls, Customer must configure its PBX to send all local calls to a Session-based Trunk Group. (f) Operator Services. Available for calling or credit card billed calls only. No collect or third party billing calls are supported. Pricing for Operator Services is located in the FCC Operator Services Informational Tariff posted at: http:\/\/www.centurylink.com\/tariffs\/fcc qcc ops t.pdf. (g) Dedicated VoIP Interconnect. Dedicated VoIP Interconnect provides Customers using CenturyLink IQ Networking Private Ports or CenturyLink IQ Networking Enhanced Ports with completely separate VPN access to the first network element of the Service. An additional NRC and MRC apply for this Dedicated VoIP Interconnect option. Standard Service (i.e., without the Dedicated VoIP Interconnect option) provides customers using CenturyLink IQ Networking Private Ports or CenturyLink IQ Networking Enhanced Ports with shared vPn access to the same elements at no additional cost. (h) SIP REFER. SIP REFER allows Customer to transfer a call using a specific network protocol that causes the network to complete the call transfer rather than CPE. If Customer purchases SIP REFER with Enterprise Session Pooling, the SIP REFER MRC will be applied to all Sessions in the usage-based pool. (i) Enterprise Diversity. Customer may purchase optional Enterprise Diversity with the Service. Enterprise Diversity provides a standby Enterprise Session Pool that is only accessible by Customer when the network switch where the pool is built is out of service. The standby pool is a mirrored copy of the primary pool. Enterprise Diversity may provide diverse physical access to the Service. Enterprise Session Pooling is required to enable Enterprise Diversity. Enterprise Diversity applies to all pools within the Enterprise. “Enterprise” means company-wide across all Customer locations. (j) Site\/Switch Diversity. Customer may purchase optional Site\/Switch Diversity with Enterprise Diversity Service. Site\/Switch Diversity provides a second SIP Trunk Group that homes to a different network facility in the CenturyLink network than the primary Trunk Group. Site\/Switch Diversity does not provide diverse physical access to the Service. Enterprise Diversity is required to enable Site\/Switch Diversity at a site level. (k) Enterprise Session Pooling. Customer may purchase optional Enterprise Session Pooling with the Service. Enterprise Session Pooling enables Customer to share SIP Trunk Sessions among SIP Trunk termination locations. CenturyLink provides the first Flat Session Pool at no charge. Additional Flat Session Pools after the first one will be charged as shown in the Pricing Attachment. Customer may also order Usage Pools so long as Customer has purchased Flat Pools. The number of Usage Pools cannot exceed the number of Flat Pools. There is no charge for Usage Pools. (l) Toll-Free: Inbound Toll Free services are available with the Service. CenturyLink is required by the FCC to state in this Service Exhibit that Customer is prohibited from using any Toll Free TN, or other TN advertised or widely understood to be Toll Free, in a manner that would violate FCC rule 47 CFR 64.1504. Unless otherwise provided in the Pricing Attachment, rates for domestic and international Toll Free service are in the ISS. 2.4 Service Conditions. The following conditions apply to the Service: (a) Site Conditions. Customer is responsible for ensuring that its Customer Environment is fully prepared for the convergence of voice and data services. Customer is responsible for fully understanding how changes in its data network will affect voice quality and NSP #: 120355 Contract Code: 191003 Page 31 of 129 CONFIDENTIAL © CenturyLink, Inc.

The addition of new data network applications, increased usage, movement of Customer personnel, and equipment failures can all have an impact on Service using that network. CenturyLink has no liability for Service deficiencies or interruptions caused by failures or malfunctions in the Customer Environment. (b) Voice Services (Long Distance and Toll Free). CenturyLink will provide the voice services under the terms of the Agreement, ISS, and this Service Exhibit. (i) Description; Service Guide and SLA. Long Distance accepts domestic and international dedicated long distance traffic in IP format and converts such traffic for transmission across the telecommunications network. Toll Free accepts domestic and international toll free traffic and converts it into IP format for transmission to Customer. The voice services are dedicated offerings. Unless otherwise provided in the Pricing Atatchment, pricing for the voice services can be found in the ISS. All use of the voice services will comply with and be subject to the Services Guide and applicable sections of the SIP Trunk SLA, which is posted at http:\/\/qwest.centurylink.com\/legal. CenturyLink reserves the right to refuse to accept, suspend, or limit any or all of Customer’s IP traffic not complying with the Service Guide technical specifications or that CenturyLink believes is adversely affecting other customers on the CenturyLink network. The Service Guide is incorporated into this Service Exhibit by this reference. CenturyLink may reasonably modify the Service Guide to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations and to protect CenturyLink's network and customers, and such change will be effective upon posting to the Web site. (ii) Telemarketing. With respect to any outbound Long Distance: (a) Per the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), telemarketers are required to transmit their telephone number to Caller ID services. As such, all telemarketers using CenturyLink commercial services are required to provide CPN\/pseudo-CPN and a CGN provisioned with the service: IF A TELEMARKETER DOES NOT PROVIDE CENTURYLINK WITH A NUMBER FOR THIS PURPOSE, THE CALL WILL BE BLOCKED BY CENTURYLINK; and (b) Federal Do Not Calls rules require that companies that telemarket or engage in telephone solicitations adhere to the requirements set forth in 47 C.F.R. section 64.1200 (FCC) and 16 C.F.R. Part 310 (FTC). Please consult with your company’s legal advisor for more information. (iii) Non-Completed Calls. “Non-completed Call Percentage Threshold\" means 30% of all attempted calls, both completed and non-completed. If the percentage of Customer’s calls that do not complete (out of all attempted calls) meets or exceeds the Non - completed Call Percentage Threshold for any given monthly billing cycle, CenturyLink may, upon 30 calendar days notice to Customer, disconnect any and all circuit(s) providing Service on which the Non-completed Call Percentage Threshold was exceeded. (iv) International Toll Free. International Toll Free Service “ITFS”\/Universal International Freephone Number “UIFN” billing increments: ITFS\/UIFN Initial Billing Period Incremental Billing Period\nInbound International (excluding Mexico) to US 30 seconds 6 seconds\nInbound Canada to US 30 seconds 6 seconds\nInbound US to Canada 30 seconds 6 seconds\nInbound Mexico to US 60 seconds 60 seconds\nITFS\/UIFN In certain countries, the following applications are not permitted for ITFS\/UIFN: calling card, VRU (Voice Response Unit), operator services, third-country termination, dial tone, dial up access, dead air or any other response the individual carrier deems inappropriate to ITFS. Originating carriers treat all carriers equally regarding these restrictions. Restrictions on usage are imposed on all other carriers, including CenturyLink, by the originating carriers. ITFS service orders violating the restrictive guidelines of the originating carrier will not be processed by CenturyLink's ITFS\/UIFN implementation group. Toll-free originating carriers finding usage in violation of their guidelines can, and will, block toll-free numbers on the originating side of the call without notice or appeal. Carriers may change their restrictions to be more restrictive without notice to CenturyLink. Information regarding which country has this type of limitation is located in the \"ITFS\/UIFN Availability Matrix\". CenturyLink is able to supply a copy of the ITFS\/UIFN Availability Matrix upon request. CenturyLink cannot guarantee that all new ITFS\/UIFN numbers are tested due to random voluntary testing of ITFS\/UIFN numbers by the foreign PTTs. ITFS\/UIFN numbers may be disconnected by foreign PTTs without advanced notification due to Customer fraudulent use or no usage. Customer agrees to maintain minimum usage for each number on a regular basis and adhere to the restricted application guideline (as stated in Availability Matrix). In situations when an ITFS\/UIFN is disconnected by a foreign PTT, it is the Customer’s responsibility to submit an order for a new number. CenturyLink does not guarantee that the same number can be re - instated. All PTT's reserve the right to decline, cancel, or change international services at any time with or without notice. UIFN is a service which allocates 1 toll free number to be used in multiple foreign countries to call the United States and bill to the number in the United States. Countries which are currently available for UIFN are: Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Luxembourg, Macau, Malaysia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Philippines, Portugal, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, and United Kingdom. There is an NRC and an MRC, which are applicable per number, regardless of the number of countries in which the number is active. The per minute rates using the UIFN number are the same as the ITFS rates. The UIFN nonrecurring charge and NSP #: 120355 Contract Code: 191003 Page 32 of 129 CONFIDENTIAL © CenturyLink, Inc.

Unless otherwise provided in the Pricing Attachment, all rates are located in the ISS. (c) Connectivity. As of the effective date of this Service Exhibit, the Service may only be used with Approved Connectivity. Customer must purchase Approved Connectivity separately. CenturyLink may add to the Approved Connectivity list from time to time. The then current list of Approved Connectivity is available to Customer upon request. CenturyLink has no liability for Service deficiencies or interruptions caused by Customer, its employees, contractors or agents, or End Users reconfiguring or misconfiguring the Approved Connectivity. (d) Off-Net Call Billing. Off-Net Call charges are quoted in full minutes. Each domestic Off-Net Call is measured and billed for an initial 18 seconds and rounded up to the next 6 second increment after the first 18 seconds. Domestic Off-Net Calls are also subject to a 30 second MATR per call. If the MATR is not met in a particular month, CenturyLink may add $0.01 to the per minute charge for all domestic Off-Net Calls during that month. Each international Off-Net Call (except to Mexico) is measured and billed for an initial 30 seconds and rounded up to the next 6 second increment after the first 30 seconds. Each International Off-Net Call to Mexico is measured and billed for an initial one minute and rounded up to the next minute after the first minute. (e) Unsupported Calls. The Service does not support collect or third party billing. The Service may not support 311, 511 and\/or other x11 services (other than 911, 711 and 411 dialing) in all service areas. The Service does not support remote bridged line appearances (“Remote BLAs”). Customer is specifically instructed not to enable Remote BLAs on its IP devices used with the Service. Additional information regarding potential issues with Remote BLAs is found in the “911 Emergency Service” section of this Service Exhibit. (f) Area of Use. The Service is intended to be used only at one of the Customer PPU locations in the United States (not including U.S. territories). Additionally, Customer may not use IP enabled stationary devices that are assigned to, designated for, or configured for use at one PPU location in any other location, unless Customer has requested a temporary change of its 911 location, and has received approval and the 911 Update Confirmation from CenturyLink as set forth in subpart (g) below. 911 emergency calls automatically route to the appropriate 911 center based upon the CenturyLink-Approved 911 Location. If Customer or an End User tries to use the Service (i) at a location other than a CenturyLink-Approved 911 Location (including without limitation, using IP enabled devices assigned to, designated for, or configured for use at one location in a different location) or (ii) outside of the United States (including in any U.S. territories), they do so at their own risk (including without limitation, the risk that Customer will not have access to 911 emergency services and\/or such activity violates local laws in the jurisdiction where Customer or an End User tries to use the Service). (g) Use of Service at a Temporary Location. Customer may temporarily use the Service at a location other than the Customer PPU location only after obtaining CenturyLink’s approval either (i) by contacting CenturyLink at 1-877-878-7543 or (ii) by submitting a 911 location change request through the CenturyLink Business portal. Customer must submit a 911 location change request both before using Service at the temporary location and before returning to the Customer PPU location. Failure to obtain CenturyLink’s approval is prohibited and constitutes a misuse of the Service. Such misuse will result in 911 calls being routed to the incorrect 911 operator based on incorrect address information. Use of Service at a temporary location may not exceed six (6) months in duration. Upon submission of Customer’s 911 location change request, CenturyLink will reject the request, or accept and begin processing the request. Customer is responsible for checking the CenturyLink Control Center Business portal to confirm if the request was rejected or accepted. Customer will be notified of the 911 Update Interval (defined in Section 3.1 below) at the time the request is accepted via the CenturyLink Control Center Business portal. Upon completion of the 911 location change and the 911 Update Interval, an e-mail will be sent to Customer’s e-mail address notifying Customer that 911 service has been successfully moved and is ready for use (“911 Update Confirmation”). In the event Customer does not receive such confirmation by expiration of the 911 Update Interval, Customer agrees to contact CenturyLink at 1-877-878-7543. Any 911 calls placed prior to receiving the 911 Update Confirmation will be routed according to the last CenturyLink-Approved 911 Location. If, upon submission of a 911 location change request, CenturyLink rejects the change request, Customer understands that CenturyLink has not approved using the Service at that new location and, as such, Customer is prohibited from using the Service there. (h) Compliance. The Service cannot be used for any unlawful, abusive, or fraudulent purpose, including without limitation, using the Service in a way that: (i) interferes with CenturyLink's ability to provide service to CenturyLink customers; (ii) avoids Customer's obligation to pay for communication services; (iii) constitutes a criminal offense; (iv) gives rise to a civil liability; (v) otherwise violates any laws; or (vi) constitutes a resale arrangement with a third party (e.g., wholesaling of the Service is not permitted). Without limiting the foregoing, the Service cannot be used for auto-dialing, continuous or extensive call forwarding, fax broadcasting or fax blasting, or for uses that result in excessive usage inconsistent with normal usage patterns. (i) Authorized Use. Customer and its End Users are the only parties authorized to access the Service. Customer and its End Users are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of passwords used by Customer and its End Users and will ensure that all use of the Service complies with the Agreement and this Service Exhibit. Customer is responsible for unauthorized use of the Service. (j) Power Outages; Network Connectivity, Customer Data Network and CPE Failures; Maintenance Work; Moving Equipment. The Service will not operate (including, without limitation, End Users will be unable to access emergency 911 services) if any of the following items fail: (i) power used with the Service; (ii) the Approved Connectivity used with the Service (including without limitation, failures caused by suspension or termination of the Approved Connectivity under the terms of that service); (iii) the Customer NSP #: 120355 Contract Code: 191003 Page 33 of 129 CONFIDENTIAL © CenturyLink, Inc. All Rights Reserved. v1.073015 DocuSign Envelope ID: 7105E734-21CC-4511-AE45-FEBD4D3EA099 CENTURYLINK® TOTAL ADVANTAGE® AGREEMENT SIP TRUNK SERVICE EXHIBIT Environment; (iv) the Approved Connectivity router; (v) Customer premises routers and switches; (vi) the IP enabled devices used with the Service; or (vii) customer’s SIP signaling interface. Additionally, the Service will not operate (including, without limitation, End Users will be unable to access emergency 911 services) while maintenance work is being performed. If Customer has requested a temporary change of its 911 location, and has received approval and the 911 Update Confirmation from CenturyLink as set forth in subpart (g) above, Customer may move the IP handset only. (k) Privacy. CenturyLink, its affiliates and third-party vendors, may access and use information regarding Customer bandwidth usage and performance of CPE, software, and Service to: (a) perform related registration (equipment serial number, activation date, and WTN provided to manufacturer), maintenance, support, and other service-quality activities and (b) verify AUP compliance and network performance. (l) Telephone Numbers. Customer must provision at least one TN for use with the Service. The TNs may be new TNs or Ported TNs. If Customer requests Ported TNs, Customer authorizes CenturyLink to process its order for Service and notify Customer’s current carrier of Customer’s decision to switch its local and local toll services to the Service. Customer will be responsible to p romptly provide CenturyLink with its Customer Service Record (CSR) from customer’s current carrier to facilitate porting of numbers. CenturyLink’s approved porting window is 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. eastern time. If Customer does not order new TNs from CenturyLink, and Ported TNs are not ported within 60 days of the Start of Service Date for a specific location, CenturyLink reserves the right to terminate Service at that location. Additionally, the Start of Service Date and commencement of billing will not depend on completion of porting. If Customer requests cancellation of Service, it is Customer’s sole responsibility to arrange porting of any telephone numbers Customer wants to retain. If porting of numbers is not completed within 30 days following Customer’s request for Service cancellation, CenturyLink may terminate Service and Customer will lose all telephone numbers. There may be limitations to number porting between providers. Due to the portability of VoIP services, for example, providers may allow non-geographic numbers to be used in connection with their service. (m) Usage-Based Trunk Group Utilization. Customer must maintain a peak utilization of usage-based Trunk Groups to support usage-based services of 60 percent or higher. “Peak utilization” means the maximum utilization for a usage-based Trunk Group reached at any point during the month. Each month, CenturyLink will calculate the peak utilization over Customer’s usage-based Trunk Groups. If peak utilization is less than 60% for three consecutive months, CenturyLink reserves the right to reduce the number of Sessions in the affected usage-based Trunk Group such that the peak utilization of the Trunk Group is at least 75%. An MRC will not apply to Sessions assigned to usage-based Trunk Groups. (n) Third Party Billed Services. The Service does not support billing for third party services such as online subscription services, equipment leases and wireless services. Customer will be responsible for payment of all such charges directly to the third party provider. (o) Local Origination. Customer agrees that the SIP Diversion Header, ANI and Calling Party Number delivered with each outbound call will accurately reflect the location of the originating party so that appropriate long distance charges may be applied for each call, where applicable. For example, Customer may not utilize tail end hop off routing to route long distance calls across a private WAN VoIP network and drop off the long distance calls to the PSTN as local calls at a remote gateway. Failure to comply will constitute a material breach of the Agreement. 2.5 SLA. Service is subject to the SIP Trunk SLA. Approved Connectivity (purchased separately) is subject to the CenturyLink IQ Networking SLA, and not to the SIP Trunk SLA. Both SLAs are attached to the Agreement. All other services, facilities, and components relating to the SIP Trunk Service, including without limitation any CPE, the Customer Environment, the Customer SIP Signaling interface, Customer premise switches and routers, devices used with the Service, another carrier’s IP network, and the PSTN are not included in the SLA measurement. The SLA credit will provide Customer's sole remedy for any interruptions or deficiencies in the Service. NSP #: 120355 Contract Code: 191003 Page 34 of 129 CONFIDENTIAL © CenturyLink, Inc. All Rights Reserved. v1.073015 DocuSign Envelope ID: 7105E734-21CC-4511-AE45-FEBD4D3EA099 CENTURYLINK® TOTAL ADVANTAGE® AGREEMENT SIP TRUNK SERVICE EXHIBIT 3. 911 Emergency Service. ^WARNING POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS SITUATION WHICH IF NOT AVOIDED COULD RESULT IN DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY. PLEASE READ CAREFULLY. 3.1 Required Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) Warning. The FCC requires that CenturyLink inform Customer of potential limitations to 911 services using SIP Trunk Service and bundles or packages that include SIP Trunk Service. The Service provides access to 911 emergency service only on stationary devices (and not mobile devices). The Service does not support any outgoing calls, including calls to 911 emergency service from a mobile device. 911 emergency services will not be available or may not function properly (e.g., they may not route to the correct public safety answering point or “PSAP”) under the following circumstances: (i) if the Service is used at a location other than a CenturyLink-Approved 911 Location in the United States (not including U.S. territories), or if an IP-enabled stationary device is moved within the CenturyLink-Approved 911 Location and not reconfigured; (ii) if Customer selects a telephone number that is not associated with the geographic area of the installed service and Customer neglects to ensure the telephone number is registered for the installed CenturyLink-Approved 911 Location (e.g., if Customer chooses a California number for use in a Colorado location); (iii) for initial installation of Service - on average 5 days, but for as long as 30 days after installation of Service due to time required to update 911 databases with customer information; (iv) for use of Service at a temporary location - until CenturyLink has completed the 911 Update Interval and sent the 911 Update Confirmation to Customer’s e-mail address of record. “911 Update Interval” is approximately 15 minutes, unless further address verification is required, in which case the 911 Update Interval could be up to 72 hours (Important: Customer and End Users should always check for the 911 Update Confirmation before using 911 service after a temporary move); (v) if the Service fails or degrades for any reason, such as failures resulting from power outages, CPE failure (e.g., Internet connectivity routers, Customer’s data network and equipment, Customer premises switches and routers, phones, handsets, and other IP-enabled devices), cable cuts, or any Service or broadband outage or degradation (including without limitation, failures caused by suspension or termination of the Service); or (vi) while maintenance work is being performed. Additionally, CenturyLink does not support Remote BLAs on IP devices used with the Service. If a Remote BLA is enabled, and Customer or an End User make a 911 call from the Remote BLA line, the 911 call will incorrectly route to the PSAP associated with the 911 location of the telephone number assigned to the Remote BLA, and not to the 911 location of the calling party. For example, if an End User has a Remote BLA for a colleague in Chicago on a phone located in San Francisco, and End User in San Francisco places a 911 call on the Remote BLA line, emergency services will be routed to the 911 location in Chicago associated with the phone number of the Remote BLA, not to the 911 location in San Francisco. 3.2 Additional Information Regarding the Limitations of 911 Services. When dialing 911 with the Service, End Users should always state the nature of the emergency, and include End User location and number. The default PSAP may not be able to call the End User back if the call is not completed, is dropped or is disconnected, or if End User is unable to tell the PSAP their number and physical location. The PSAP to which the call is directed will be based on the street address and calling party number for the CenturyLink-Approved 911 Location. The number will be delivered to the PSAP with the 911 call and the PSAP will have the CenturyLink-Approved 911 Location associated with that calling party number. End User’s CenturyLink-Approved 911 Location may not sufficiently pinpoint the specific location of the emergency; therefore, End Users must immediately tell the dispatcher the specific location of the emergency so the PSAP can locate the End User and assist with the emergency. CENTURYLINK RECOMMENDS THAT CUSTOMER AND END USERS ALWAYS HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF ACCESSING TRADITIONAL 911 SERVICES. 3.3 No Privacy Rights. Customer acknowledges that there is no right of privacy with respect to the transmission of number, name, or address when the Service is used to access 911 or other numbers used in conjunction with 911 or similar emergency services, either by Customer or End Users. 3.4 Customer Must Notify End Users of 911 Limits. Customer will notify all End Users (i) of the limitations on access to 911 emergency service described in the Agreement and this Service Exhibit; and (ii) that access to 911 emergency service and an appropriate PSAP is only available at the CenturyLink-Approved 911 Location and is not available using an IP enabled mobile device. CenturyLink will provide labels that will indicate that 911 service has limited availability and functionality when used with SIP Trunk, and CenturyLink recommends that the labels be placed on or near the equipment associated with the Services. 3.5 Limitation of Liability. CENTURYLINK, ITS AFFILIATES, AGENTS AND CONTRACTORS (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY SERVICE PROVIDER PROVIDING SERVICES ASSOCIATED WITH ACCESS TO 911 EMERGENCY SERVICE) WILL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY WHATSOEVER FOR ANY PERSONAL INJURY TO OR DEATH OF ANY PERSON, FOR ANY LOSS, DAMAGE OR DESTRUCTION OF ANY PROPERTY RELATING TO THE USE, LACK OF ACCESS TO OR PROVISION OF, 911 EMERGENCY SERVICE. CUSTOMER AGREES TO DEFEND AND INDEMNIFY CENTURYLINK, ITS AFFILIATES, AGENTS AND CONTRACTORS FROM ALL THIRD PARTY CLAIMS, LIABILITIES, FINES, PENALTIES, COSTS AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEYS’ FEES, ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO 911 DIALING (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, LACK OF ACCESS TO 911 EMERGENCY SERVICES, CUSTOMER’S FAILURE TO ADVISE CENTURYLINK OF CORRECT ADDRESSES WHERE IP ENABLED DEVICES USED WITH THE SERVICE ARE LOCATED, CUSTOMER’S FAILURE TO NOTIFY ALL END USERS OF THE LIMITATIONS ON ACCESS TO 911 EMERGENCY SERVICE, OR CUSTOMER’S MOVEMENT OF AN IP ENABLED DEVICE TO A LOCATION THAT HAS NOT BEEN INPUT INTO THE SERVICE SYSTEMS).

V1.073015 DocuSign Envelope ID: 7105E734-21CC-4511-AE45-FEBD4D3EA099 CENTURYLINK® TOTAL ADVANTAGE® AGREEMENT SIP TRUNK SERVICE EXHIBIT 3.6 Use of SIP Diversion Headers on 911 Calls. Customer may only use SIP Diversion Headers when using the Call Forwarding feature with Service. Customer shall not send SIP Diversion Headers on all calls, and in particular shall never send SIP Diversion Headers on 911 calls. Sending SIP Diversion Headers on a 911 call may cause the call to route to the incorrect PSAP, or to the correct PSAP but without the correct Customer phone number and location information. 3.7 Acknowledgement of 911 Limitations. By initialing below, Customer acknowledges that CenturyLink has advised it of the 911 limitations set forth in this Service Exhibit, that Customer understands this information, and that Customer accepts the Service with these limitations. Using CenturyLink’s electronic signature process for this Acknowledgment is acceptable. PRINT CUSTOMER COMPANY NAME: PRINT CUSTOMER REPRESENTATIVE’S NAME: CUSTOMER REPRESENTATIVE’S INITIALS: Vantiv Ramez M. Fiani 4. Term; Cancellation. This Service Exhibit will commence upon the Effective Date of the Agreement (or, if applicable, an amendment to the Agreement if this Service Exhibit is added to the Agreement after its Effective Date) and will conclude upon the termination of the last-to-terminate Service ordered hereunder. Either party may cancel Service by providing notice of such cancellation to the other party at least 60 days prior to the date of cancellation. Customer will remain liable for charges accrued but unpaid as of the cancellation date of Service, including charges for Service used by Customer or its End Users if cancellation has been delayed for any reason, such as delays for porting Customer telephone numbers to another carrier. The initial Trunk Group will have a minimum term equal to 1 year (“Minimum Service Term”). The Minimum Service Term will commence on the Start of Service Date for the initial Trunk Group. Customer will be eligible for Service rates applicable to the Minimum Service Term selected. Trunk Groups added after the initial Trunk Group will be coterminous with the initial Trunk Group, and will receive the same Service rates as the initial Trunk Group. If prior to the conclusion of the Minimum Service Term (including before the Start of Service Date), Customer cancels Service for reasons other than for Cause, or CenturyLink cancels the Service for Cause, Customer will also be liable for: (i) the amount of any NRCs discounted or waived; (ii) all installation costs and expenses incurred by CenturyLink to install such Service, if applicable; (iii) 100% of the balance of the Session and TN MRCs that otherwise would have become due for the unexpired portion of the first 12 months of the Minimum Service Term, if any; and (iv) 35% of the balance of the Session and TN MRCs beyond the first 12 months that otherwise would have become due for the unexpired portion of the Minimum Service Term (collectively the “Cancellation Charges). 5. Charges. Charges for the Service are as set forth in the Pricing Attachment. The Net Rates will be used to calculate Contributory Charges. Charges will commence within five days of the Start of Service Date. Customer will not be eligible for any discounts or promotional offers other than those specifically set forth in the Agreement and this Service Exhibit. Service will remain taxed based on the PPU locations where Customer utilizes Service, and not on a temporary CenturyLink-Approved 911 Location. Domestic and international Off-Net Call charges and inbound toll free charges, can be modified immediately upon notice to Customer (including without limitation, upon CenturyLink’s posting such modifications in the ISS or other Web site designated by CenturyLink for that pricing, or providing any other notice to Customer). 6. AUP. All use of the Services will comply with the AUP, posted at http:\/\/qwest.centurylink.com\/legal and incorporated by reference into this Service Exhibit. CenturyLink may reasonably modify the AUP to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations and to protect CenturyLink's network and customers, and such change will be effective upon posting to the website. Any changes to the AUP will be consistent with the purpose of the AUP to encourage responsible use of CenturyLink's networks, systems, services, web sites, and products. 7. E-Mail Information\/Updates. Customer acknowledges and agrees that CenturyLink may contact Customer via e-mail at the e¬ mail address provided to CenturyLink when Customer ordered the Service for any reason relating to the Service. 8.1 Customer agrees to make a Customer representative available for Service testimonials and to assist CenturyLink in securing name and likeness releases from such representative. 8.2 Except for Customer lists, Customer will have the right to approve all Materials prior to publication, use or distribution, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Customer will have 5 business days to review and approve Materials submitted by CenturyLink. Materials not specifically disapproved within this 5-day period will be deemed approved. CenturyLink is not obligated to use any Customer-approved Materials. 8.3 Customer agrees that except for Customer’s rights in its name, logo, trademarks and\/or service marks, CenturyLink shall be sole owner of all rights, title and interest, including without limitation all copyright, in and to the Materials and will retain exclusive control over their use and distribution. If as a result of the publication, use, or distribution of the Materials, CenturyLink receives notice claiming that Customer’s name, logo, trademarks and\/or service marks infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party, CenturyLink will forward such notice to Customer. Customer agrees to indemnify CenturyLink for all costs, fees or expenses incurred by CenturyLink as a result of any third-party claim of infringement, except that CenturyLink will be responsible for reasonable costs associated with terminating ongoing publication, use or distribution of the Materials.

CenturyLink QCC will provide Local Access Service (\"Service\") under the terms of this Service Exhibit, the Agreement and the RSS. 2. Service Description and Availability. 2.1 Description. Service provides the physical connection between the Service Address and the CenturyLink Domestic Network. Service includes any entrance cable or drop wire to, and equipment maintained by CenturyLink at the Demarcation Point, but does not include CPE, Extended Wiring, inside wiring, or other equipment not maintained by CenturyLink. Customer is responsible for any additional terminations beyond the Demarcation Point. All equipment owned by CenturyLink remains property of CenturyLink. Customer disclaims any interest in any equipment, property or licenses used by CenturyLink to provide Service. CenturyLink will not provide Service to a residential location, even if business is conducted at that location. Service is not a standalone service and Customer must purchase the Service in connection with another CenturyLink service for which a local loop is required. 2.2 Types of Service Technologies. CenturyLink uses the following different technologies to provide Service. Some technologies or speeds may not be available in all areas or with certain types of Service. (a) Special Access. “Special Access” means Service using digital signal bandwidths DS0, DS1 and DS3 or Optical Carrier signal bandwidths OC3, OC12, OC48 and OC192. (b) Ethernet Local Access (“ELA”). ELA is available at bandwidths varying from 1 Mbps to 1,000 Mbps (1G) and 10G (Cross¬ Connect Access only). ELA is available in the following options: Native Single-Class-of-Service (CoS) Low, Native Single-CoS Medium, Native Single-CoS High, Native Multi-CoS, ELA over SONET, or Ethernet Virtual Access (“EVA”). “Native Single-CoS Low” is a layer 2, switched, native service using a standard Ethernet offering from the local access provider. Native Single-CoS Low is not recommended for use with critical applications (i.e. voice), but is ideal for non-critical applications (i.e. Internet and email traffic). “Native Single-CoS Medium” is a layer 2, switched, native service using a better-than-standard Ethernet offering from the local access provider. Native Single-CoS Medium is ideal for a combination of non-critical and\/or critical applications; typically varying voice, video, and data. “Native Single-CoS High” is a layer 2, switched, native service using the best Ethernet offering from the local access provider. Native Single¬ CoS High is ideal for critical applications; typically predictable and reliable voice and data. Native Single-CoS Medium and Native Single-CoS High are only available with the following CenturyLink services: CenturyLink IQ® Networking Internet Port, Private Port or Enhanced Port with Secure Internet Gateway, E-Line, or Ethernet Private Line (“EPL”). Native Single-CoS Medium or Native Single¬ CoS High circuit speed must match the maximum CenturyLink IQ Networking port, E-Line, or EPL bandwidth. “Native Multi-CoS” is a layer 2, switched, native service closely aligning the CenturyLink IQ Networking QoS and the local access provider’s Ethernet class of service offering and is only available with CenturyLink IQ Networking Private Port or Enhanced Port with Secure Internet Gateway. At Customer’s discretion, Native Single-CoS Low, Native Single-CoS Medium, Native Single-Cos High, or Native Multi-CoS may be used to support CoS for critical applications (i.e. voice). “ELA over SONET” is a layer 1, SONET-based service. EVA is a layer 2, Ethernet¬ based service that provides customers with a premium non-oversubscribed connection with Fast E and Gig E connection types. Customer may experience delayed installation intervals due to construction requirements and available bandwidths may be limited due to distance and available Ethernet-supported facilities from the local access provider. (c) Wavelength Local Access. “Wavelength Local Access” means Service using wave division multiplexing technology. Wavelength Local Access is available at bandwidths of 1 GbE, 10 GbE LAN PHY, 2.5 G (OC48), 10 GbE WAN PHY (OC192), 40G, OTU1, OTU2, OTU3, 1G, 2G, 4G and 10G. (d) DSL Local Access. “DSL Local Access” means Leased Access using digital subscriber line (“DSL”) technology. DSL Local Access is available at bandwidths varying from 128 kbps\/64 kbps to 15000 Mbps\/1000 Mbps. Customer may experience delayed installation intervals due to Construction requirements and available bandwidths may be limited due to distance and available DSL- supported facilities from the local access provider. (e) IP Connection. “IP Connection” is a Layer 3, symmetrical transport service that utilizes established dedicated IP and MPLS transport technologies. When purchasing IP Connection, Customer agrees that it will use the IP Connection only for the provision of either (i) wireline broadband Internet access (as defined in applicable Federal Communications Commission orders and regulations), or (ii) wireline broadband Internet access plus additional information services, with wireline broadband Internet access constituting a principal use. IP Connection provides connectivity between single Customer locations within an affiliate LEC metropolitan area and a “hub” location using industry standard dedicated IP and MPLS protocols. The transmission speed depends on the amount of bandwidth available at the respective Customer location, which may be dependent on available underlying technology at the location. Service is available over multiple designs, which may include but not be limited to symmetrical VDSL2 connectivity with MPLS transport supporting speeds up to 40\/40mg and symmetrical GPON connectivity with MPLS transport supporting speeds up to 1G\/1G, all providing an IP Connection over the given transport solution. (x) Frame Local Access. “Frame Local Access” means Leased Access using frame relay technology. Frame Local Access is available at bandwidths varying from 56 kbps to 44,736 kbps. When providing Frame Local Access, Customer has the option to have CenturyLink monitor Service for performance and up\/down stats via a management permanent virtual circuit. By ordering Frame Local Access with monitoring, Customer agrees to provide CenturyLink with access to the serial interface of its customer premises equipment to allow CenturyLink to monitor the availability of Frame Local Access. By ordering Frame Local Access without monitoring, Customer understands that CenturyLink will not monitor the availability of Frame Local Access. 2.3 Types of Service. CenturyLink offers the following three types of Service: CenturyLink Provided Access, Customer Provided Access or Cross-Connect Access. NSP #: 120355 Contract Code: 191003 Page 40 of 129 CONFIDENTIAL © CenturyLink, Inc. All Rights Reserved. v1.073015 DocuSign Envelope ID: 7105E734-21CC-4511-AE45-FEBD4D3EA099 CENTURYLINK® TOTAL ADVANTAGE® AGREEMENT LOCAL ACCESS SERVICE EXHIBIT 2.3.1 CenturyLink Provided Access. “CenturyLink Provided Access” or “CLPA” means either On-Net Access or Leased Access. (a) On-Net Access. For On-Net Access, Customer must be located in a CenturyLink designated building in which On-Net Access is generally available. On-Net Access is generally available as Special Access (except at the DS0 bandwidth), ELA, and Wavelength Local Access. Depending on the Service Address, On-Net Access may be provided through an existing CPOP, newly built CPOP, existing intra-building local loop facilities, or connections to a third party provider where CenturyLink coordinates the connectivity between CenturyLink facilities and facilities of a service provider with whom CenturyLink is interconnected. On-Net Access is subject to the On-Net Service Level Agreement located at http:\/\/www.centurylink.com\/legal\/, which is subject to change. (b) Leased Access. Leased Access is generally available as Special Access, ELA, Wavelength Local Access, Frame Local Access, and DSL Local Access at the bandwidths described in this Service Exhibit for those access types. Customer may request a specific local access provider for Leased Access from a list of available providers with whom CenturyLink has interconnect agreements. CenturyLink will attempt to use the Customer requested provider, but both final routing and the provider actually used will be chosen by CenturyLink. Where available for Special Access, ELA and Wavelength Local Access, Customer may request CenturyLink to provide a separate fiber facility path for a protection system between the local access provider’s serving wire center and the Service Address (“Protect Route”). Protect Route uses backup electronics and two physically separate facility paths in the provisioning of Service. If the working facility or electronics fail, or the Service performance becomes impaired, the facility is designed to automatically switch to the Service protect path in order to maintain a near-continuous flow of information between locations. Special Access and ELA are also generally available as a central office meet point at a local access provider central office to which Customer has a dedicated connection. 2.3.2 Customer Provided Access. “Customer Provided Access” or “CPA” means a local loop that Customer orders from a local access provider to connect Customer’s premises to the CenturyLink Domestic Network at a connection point specified by CenturyLink. CenturyLink will provide Customer with a limited letter of agency (“LOA”), which is incorporated by this reference, authorizi ng Customer to act as CenturyLink’s agent so that Customer’s local access provider will connect Customer’s premises to the CenturyLink Domestic Network. Customer will also need to execute a CPA-DAR Addendum for CPA POP with ELA or Wavelength Local Access. Customer will pay a CPA charge to CenturyLink when Customer uses the following: (a) Special Access CPA dedicated facilities or ELA CPA virtual local area network (“VLAN”), both of which are dedicated entrance facilities CenturyLink leases from a local access p rovider and that carry traffic only from CenturyLink; or (b) ELA CPA POP, which requires CenturyLink to provide space and power for the local access provider to install Ethernet equipment; or (c) Wavelength Local Access. Customer will pay a CPA charge to CenturyLink when Customer uses Special Access CPA non-dedicated facilities owned by local access providers and that carry traffic from multiple carriers, including CenturyLink, if the provider charges CenturyLink for those facilities. CPA ELA VLAN is an access type where CenturyLink will provision and assign an Ethernet virtual circuit from a CenturyLink POP to a Customer designated Ethernet facility leased from a common Ethernet service provider. This access will be used to connect to a CenturyLink VLAN assignment on a CenturyLink IQ Networking Internet or Private Port or E-Line. CenturyLink will not bill customer a CPA charge for an IP layer 3 expansion site because Customer, not CenturyLink, is responsible for ordering a cross-connect from the IP layer 3 expansion site manager to meet CenturyLink in the IP layer 3 expansion site’s meet-me-room. CPA is the responsibility of Customer and CenturyLink will not pay for or troubleshoot components of CPA. 2.3.3 Cross-Connect Access. “Cross-Connect Access” or “XCA” means: (a) an intra-POP connection between certain Customer facilities with direct access to the CenturyLink Domestic Network and the CenturyLink backbone access point (either (i) located within CenturyLink's transport area where CenturyLink allows Customer to bring its own fiber directly to the CenturyLink fiber under an executed Direct Connect Agreement (“Direct Connect”) or (ii) in an area where Customer has leased space in a CPOP, a remote collocation site, or a collocation hotel under a Telecommunications Collocation License Agreement or (b) a connection between a CenturyLink-determined data center and a CenturyLink IQ Networking Port, Optical Wavelength Service (“OWS”), or E-Line (“Data Center Access”) under an executed CenturyLink TS Service Exhibit with a CenturyLink IQ Networking, OWS or E-Line Service Exhibit. Data Center Access is available in bandwidths of 100 Mbps, 1G, and 10G (CenturyLink IQ Networking and OWS only). Direct Connect requires splicing of Customer and CenturyLink fibers and cross-connection of individual circuits. 2.4 RSS. Customer understands that Service is an interstate telecommunications service, as defined by Federal Communications Commission regulations and represents while using the Service, more than 10% of its usage will be interstate usage. 3. Ordering. Upon acceptance of an order for a Service, CenturyLink will notify Customer of CenturyLink’s target date for the delivery of that Service (“Estimated Availability Date”). Once CenturyLink notifies Customer of the Estimated Availability Date for a Service, cancellation fees or Cancellation Charges set forth in the Cancellation section below will apply to any cancellation of that order. If Customer fails to respond to CenturyLink’s requests to arrange for the installation of a Service when CenturyLink is ready, CenturyLink may consider the affected Servcie order canceled. CenturyLink will use commercially reasonable efforts to install each such Service on or before the Estimated Availability Date, but the inability of CenturyLink to deliver Service by such date is not a default under the Agreement or this Service Exhibit. 4. Charges. Customer will pay the net rates set forth in the attached pricing attachment or a quote for Service issued by CenturyLink if the rates for Service at particular Service Address are not included in the pricing attachment, including all applicable ancillary service charges. CenturyLink invoices MRCs in advance and NRCs in arrears. If the Start of Service Date for any Service falls on any day other than the first day of the month, the first invoice to Customer will consist of: (a) the pro-rata portion of the applicable MRC covering the period from the Start of Service Date to the first day of the subsequent month; and (b) the MRC for the following NSP #: 120355 Contract Code: 191003 Page 41 of 129 CONFIDENTIAL © CenturyLink, Inc.

Charges for Service will not be used to calculate Contributory Charges. Customer will receive the rates for Service as shown on the pricing attachment regardless of whether an NPA\/NXX split or overlay occurs. 4.1 Ancillary Charges. Ancillary charges applicable to Service include but are not limited to those ancillary services set forth in this section. If an ancillary charge applies in connection with provisioning a particular Service, CenturyLink will notify Customer of the ancillary charge to be billed to Customer. Customer may either approve or disapprove CenturyLink providing the ancillary service. (a) Expedite. A local loop expedite charge applies to orders where Customer requests the delivery of Service one or more days before the Estimated Availability Date. Customer may only request to expedite CenturyLink Provided Access of Special Access and ELA orders (where underlying local access provider allows CenturyLink QCC to order an expedited service.) (b) Extended Wiring. “Extended Wiring” means additional wiring required for orders where the Customer requested termination point for Service is not located in the same location as the Demarcation Point. The Demarcation Point is typically located at a suitable location in the basement or on the first floor of a Service Address where provision is made for termination of CenturyLink’s outside distribution network facilities. Customer may only request Extended Wiring for (i) Special Access ordered as Leased Access, (ii) DSL Local Access, (iii) Ethernet Local Access (where available), and (iv) IP Connection. (c) Construction. Construction charges apply if special construction is required to extend Service to a Demarcation Point not covered by Extended Wiring or other activities that may cause CenturyLink to incur expenses for provisioning the Service (e.g., special arrangements of LEC facilities or equipment required to activate the Service) (“Construction”). If Customer does not approve of the Construction charges after CenturyLink notifies Customer of the charges, the Service ordered will be deemed cancelled. (d) Multiplexing. Customer may request multiplexing for Special Access where available. CenturyLink will multiplex lower level local loop into a higher local loop, or vice-versa, for an additional charge. CenturyLink offers multiplexing at a CPOP, at an On-Net Access building or at an ILEC\/CLEC facility providing the Leased Access. For multiplexing at a CenturyLink On-Net Access building, CenturyLink provides multiplexed circuit handoffs to Customer at the same On-Net Access Service Address. For multiplexing at ILEC\/CLEC facility, CenturyLink facilitates the delivery of multiplexed circuit handoffs to Customer at a single Service Address or at multiple Service Addresses per Customer’s request. Multiplexing is generally available at DS1 and OCn circuit levels. Pricing for multiplexing at an ILEC\/CLEC facility is on an individual case basis. (e) Changes. Ancillary change charge applies where Customer requests CenturyLink to change a local loop to a different Service Address that is within the same Customer serving wire center as the existing local loop, but a Cancellation Charge does not apply. 5. Term; Cancellation. 5.1 Term. The term of an individual Service begins on the Start of Service Date for that Service and continues for the number of months specified in the attached pricing attachment for a particular Service Address or a quote for Service issued by CenturyLink if the rates for Service at particular Service Address are not included in the pricing attachment (“Initial Service Term”). Excluding voice loops and Data Center Access with a month-to-month Initial Service Term, the Initial Service Term will not be less than 12 months. For all Leased Access that is DS-3 or less, ordered by Customer during the first 12 months of the Initial Term of the Agreement, the Service Term will be co-terminus with the Agreement. Upon expiration of the Initial Service Term, Service will automatically renew for consecutive periods equal to the Initial Service Term length (a “Renewal Service Term”). CenturyLink may change rates at any time after the Initial Service Term, but will not change rates more than once during a Renewal Service Term. For all Leased Access that is DS-3 or less, ordered by Customer during the first 12 months of the Initial Term of the Agreement, the Service Term will be co-terminus with the Agreement. 5.2 Cancellation. Upon cancellation of a Service, Customer will remain liable for (a) charges accrued but unpaid as of the cancellation date (including MRCs, NRCs and Construction charges and other ancillary charges), (b) the amount of any NRCs that CenturyLink discounted or waived, if canceled during the first 12 months of the Initial Service Term and (c) any applicable cancellation fees and Cancellation Charges set forth below. (a) Leased Access and On-Net Access—Cancellation Before the Start of Service Date. Customer will pay the cancellation fee identified in the below table if cancellation of a Service order occurs before the Start of Service Date. If Customer accepted a Constructioncharge, Customer will also pay any unpaid construction charges incurred by CenturyLink. If CenturyLink notifies Customer that Construction is required to provision a Service order and Customer cancels that order before the Start of Service Date because Customer disapproves of the Construction charge, the cancellation fee does not apply. tIncludes all types of Service Technology unless otherwise noted. Leased Access and On-Net Access Service Bandwidtht Before Start of Service Date Cancellation Fee\nDS0 (Leased Access only), DS1, DSL Local Access speeds up to 1536 Kbps\/1.024 Mbps, Frame Local Access speeds up to 1.5 Mbps $150 NRC\nDS3, OCn, DSL Local Access speeds greater than 1536 Kbps\/1.024 Mbps, Frame Local Access speeds greater than 1.5 Mbps; all ELA speeds, all Wavelength Local Access speeds, all IP Connection speeds $500 NRC\nNSP #: 120355 Contract Code: 191003 Page 42 of 129 CONFIDENTIAL © CenturyLink, Inc. All Rights Reserved. v1.073015 DocuSign Envelope ID: 7105E734-21CC-4511-AE45-FEBD4D3EA099 CENTURYLINK® TOTAL ADVANTAGE® AGREEMENT LOCAL ACCESS SERVICE EXHIBIT (b) All Service Types—Cancellation After the Start of Service Date. If a Service is canceled by Customer other than for Cause, or by CenturyLink for Cause, before the conclusion of its Initial Service Term, Customer will pay a “Cancellation Charge” equal to: (i) 100% of the balance of the MRCs that otherwise would have become due for the unexpired portion of the first 12 months of the Initial Service Term, if any, plus (ii) 35% of the balance of the MRCs that otherwise would have become due for the unexpired portion, if any, of the Initial Service Term beyond the first 12 months. (c) Moves. When Customer requests that CenturyLink move a local loop to a different Service Address that is not within the same Customer serving wire center as the existing local loop such move will be deemed a disconnect of the current local loop to which a Cancellation Charge applies and a new install of a new local loop. (d) Waiver of Cancellation Charges. CenturyLink will waive the Cancellation Charge for a cancelled Service: (i) When Customer cancels a Special Access ordered as Leased Access if it is (A) DS-3 or less, (B) is not part of a bundle or package offering that required Customer to order the local loop with other service components and (C) the local loop’s Start of Service Date was at least 12 months prior to the requested date of cancellation. (ii) When Customer upgrades existing Special Access, Native Single-CoS Low\/Medium\/High, Native Multi-Cos, ELA over SONET, or Wavelength Local Access (“Existing CLPA Service”) with new Service within the same specific type of Service technology at a higher Service speed (e.g., Special Access DS1 to Special Access DS3 or Native Single-CoS Low Fast E to Native Single¬ CoS Low Gig E) and with the same local access provider (“Upgraded CLPA Service”). The Upgraded CLPA Service will have a new Service Term beginning on its Start of Service Date. If the type of Service technology changes when Customer upgrades Existing CLPA Service, Customer must pay Cancellation Charges. (e) Customer Provided Access—Cancellation of Connectivity after Start of Service Date. To cancel CPA, Customer must provide CenturyLink with a written disconnect firm order confirmation (“DFOC”) notice from Customer’s CPA provider along with notice to cancel the CPA. If Customer fails to provide CenturyLink with the DFOC notice within 30 calendar days after CenturyLink’s receipt of the notice to cancel the CPA, or if CenturyLink disconnects CPA for Cause, then CenturyLink may disconnect the cPa or require the CPA provider to do so. Customer will remain liable for charges for the connectivity to CPA (even if Customer cannot use the CPA) until: (i) Customer furnishes the required DFOC to CenturyLink; or (ii) either party cancels the associated CPA with the CPA provider. 6. Grooming. If CenturyLink plans to groom a circuit on which Service is provided, CenturyLink will provide a grooming notice to Customer. For CPA dedicated facilities grooming, Customer will provide a signed LOA to CenturyLink so that CenturyLink can order the necessary changes. Within 20 calendar days after receipt of that notice, Customer will: (a) notify CenturyLink of its approval, which may not be unreasonably withheld; (b) state its reason for refusing; or (c) request that CenturyLink provide Customer with an LOA so Customer can order the necessary changes. Customer's failure to respond within the 20-day period will constitute approval of the groom. If the groom results in Customer incurring additional NRCs from its local access provider and Customer provides sufficient proof of the local access provider charge, CenturyLink will issue a credit to Customer equal to the local access provider NRC for each groomed circuit. If Customer refuses the groom for On-Net Access, CenturyLink will, upon 20 calendar days’ prior written notice, cancel the Service on that circuit and assess a Cancellation Charge. When Customer does not respond to a CPA dedicated facilities grooming notice or refuses a CPA dedicated facilities groom, Customer must either: (a) provide CenturyLink with a LOA\/CFA so that CenturyLink can have the local access provider cancel the circuit; or (b) work directly with the local access provider to cancel the circuit. If Customer does neither of these things, CenturyLink will pass through to Customer any costs incurred by CenturyLink from the local access provider as a result of the circuit remaining in place. “CFA” means circuit facility assignment of the CenturyLink facility, as identified by CenturyLink, to which Customer must order a local loop for connection to the CenturyLink Domestic Network. 7. Local Access Migration. Provided Customer is in compliance with its obligations under the Agreement, CenturyLink will waive the add\/move\/change Local Loops and Ports if: (i) the existing Local Loop and port has been installed for at least 12 months at the initial location; (ii) Customer orders and installs another CenturyLink Provided Local Loop (Migrated Local Loop) to another Customer location; and (iii) the Migrated Local Loop speed and MRC are equal to or greater than the existing Local Loop speed and MRC, but Customer must pay for Construction or other third-party charges related to the existing Local Loop, if any. The Migrated Local Loop will have a new Service Term beginning on the date of installation. If Customer cancels the Migrated Local Loop before the completion of the new Service Term, Customer will pay the Cancellation Charges set forth in the Cancellation Section above. All initial NRC charges will be waived so long as such Service ordered hereunder and subject to this discount remains installed and used by Customer for the duration of the first 12 months of the Service Term. Supplemental NRCs, including but not limited to: Construction, Extended Wiring, Local Loop Expedite, Local Loop Change Fee and Multiplexing, Customer Provided Access NRCs, and Cross-Connect NRCs are not eligible for any discount. 8. Definitions. Capitalized terms not defined in this Service Exhibit are defined in the Agreement. “CenturyLink Domestic Network” means the CenturyLink network located within the contiguous U.S. states and Hawaii, which is comprised only of physical media, including switches, circuits, and ports that are operated by CenturyLink. “CPOP” means a CenturyLink-owned physical point of presence that lies directly on the CenturyLink Domestic Network where direct interconnection between the CenturyLink Domestic Network and a local access provider’s network is possible. “Demarcation Point” means: (a) the physical interface between the CenturyLink Domestic Network and Customer’s telecommunications equipment or (b) the physical interface between a local access provider connecting the CenturyLink Domestic Network to Customer’s telecommunications equipment.

The ready notification will be via phone call or e-mail. Customer has five days from CenturyLink’s ready notification in which to inform CenturyLink if the circuit fails to operate error-free. Within the five-day timeframe, if Customer neither informs CenturyLink about errors nor accepts the circuit, the circuit will be considered to have been accepted and the Start of Service Date to have commenced on the fifth day following CenturyLink’s ready notification, regardless of whether Customer placed traffic over the circuit. If Customer informs CenturyLink of circuit errors within the five-day timeframe, CenturyLink will promptly take necessary, reasonable action to correct the errors, and upon correction, notify Customer that the circuit is ready.

CenturyLink QCC will provide DDoS Mitigation Service (“Service”) under the terms of the Agreement and this Service Exhibit. 2. Service. 2.1 Service Description. Service consists of Proactive Shared DDoS Mitigation and Reactive Shared DDoS Mitigation. “DDoS” means a distributed denial-of-service attack in which many systems attack a single target, thereby causing denial of service for users of the targeted system. This typically results in the loss of network connectivity and services by consuming the bandwidth of the victim network or overloading the computational resources of the victim system. Service is only available in conjunction with Customer’s separately purchased CenturyLink IQ® Networking Internet Port or CenturyLink-provided Network-Based Security. (a) Proactive Shared DDoS Mitigation. Proactive Shared DDoS Mitigation includes: (i) monitoring of Customer’s network traffic on a 24x7 basis; and (ii) CenturyLink-supplied equipment and capacity for Mitigation that is shared among multiple customers. Customer also has direct access to CenturyLink’s support team on a 24x7 basis. CenturyLink will analyze Customer’s network traffic to establish baselines for normal traffic patterns. Once baselines are established, CenturyLink will determine if an Event is taking place. If Events are determined to be Incidents, CenturyLink will forward reports to Customer. Customer may request CenturyLink to notify Customer through either a phone call or e-mail for Proactive Shared DDoS Mitigation alerts. Customer will work with CenturyLink to validate an attack and provide either verbal permission for each Incident or pre-authorized permission for CenturyLink to initiate Mitigation. (b) Reactive Shared DDoS Mitigation. Reactive Shared DDoS Mitigation includes CenturyLink-supplied equipment and capacity for Mitigation that is shared among multiple customers. Customer also has direct access to CenturyLink’s support team on a 24x7 basis. CenturyLink does not notify Customer about Customer’s network traffic anomalies. Customer is solely responsible for notifying CenturyLink of an attack and working with CenturyLink to validate the attack. Customer must provide CenturyLink verbal permission to initiate Mitigation with Reactive Shared DDoS Mitigation. 2.2 Initiation of Mitigation. Customer must approve Mitigation by: (i) providing verbal permission for each Incident, or (ii) pre¬ authorizing CenturyLink to initiate Mitigation. Pre-authorization is only available with Proactive Shared DDoS Mitigation. If Customer selects the verbal permission option, Customer will call the CenturyLink support team to begin Mitigation. If Customer selects the pre¬ authorized permission option, Customer must provide CenturyLink written notice via a change ticket in Control Center of its pre¬ authorized permission to begin Mitigation. Customer may later withdraw its pre-authorized permission via a change ticket. Change tickets require 24 hours advance notice. Customer will pre-authorize which Mitigation countermeasures CenturyLink may deploy, subject to CenturyLink’s approval. Customer understands that additional countermeasures beyond the pre-authorized countermeasures may be required to Mitigate the Incident, which may require CenturyLink to contact Customer’s Site Contact. CenturyLink will discontinue Mitigation at the Customer’s verbal request or until CenturyLink reasonably determines that the DDoS attack has subsided. When CenturyLink determines that the DDoS attack has subsided, CenturyLink will attempt to notify Customer. If CenturyLink is able to contact Customer, Customer will have the option at that time to discontinue Mitigation or continue Mitigation for up to an additional four hours. At the end of the four hours, CenturyLink will discontinue Mitigation as long as another attack has not occurred. If CenturyLink is unable to contact Customer, CenturyLink will continue Mitigation for another four hours, after which point CenturyLink will discontinue Mitigation as long as another attack has not occurred. 2.3 Customer Responsibilities. (a) Customer Information. Customer must provide CenturyLink with: (i) accurate and current contact information for Customer’s designated points of contact; (ii) advance notice of any network changes; and (iii) a list of Customer IP addresses that Customer wishes to have subject to the Service.

(b) Notification Responsibilities. Customer must provide CenturyLink with of all the following notices: (i) 24 hours advance notice of any potential promotional events or other activities that may increase Customer’s network or Web site traffic; (ii) immediate notice of any sudden events that may cause significant traffic pattern changes in Customer’s network; (iii) 24 hours advance notice of any Customer requests to change the traffic baseline; (iv) immediate notice of any additions or deletions to the list of Customer IP addresses subject to the Service; and (v) immediate notice if Customer believes it is under a DDoS attack. (c) Installation\/Setup. Customer will cooperate with CenturyLink by: (i) providing CenturyLink with all information concerning the Service reasonably requested by CenturyLink; and (ii) providing a primary and secondary site contact with relevant experience and expertise in Customer’s network operations (“Site Contact”). Customer will provide data parameters that will allow CenturyLink to determine the proper threshold levels in an attempt to diagnose a DDoS attack. CenturyLink may periodically require Customer to allow traffic monitoring to determine proper threshold levels. 2.4 Consent to Access and Use Customer Information. Customer authorizes CenturyLink or its authorized vendor to access and use Customer’s information associated with Customer’s IP-network traffic (including Content) from domestic locations and, if applicable, from international ones.

CenturyLink will, through its affiliate, Savvis Communications Corporation DBA CenturyLink TS and its affiliates (“CenturyLink TS”), provide CenturyLink TS services under the terms of the Agreement, this Service Exhibit, a Service Order and\/or Statement of Work (“SOW”). For clarification, CenturyLink TS shall be used when it is necessary to specify the CenturyLink TS affiliate, and otherwise CenturyLink and its affiliates shall hereinafter be referred to as “CenturyLink”. In the event of a conflict in any term of any documents that govern the provision of Services hereunder, the following order of precedence will apply in descending order of control: the Service Schedule, this Service Exhibit, the Agreement, any Service Guide, the SLA, the Service Order(s) and SOW(s). Capitalized terms not defined herein are defined in the Agreement. “BCD” or “Billing Commencement Date” means the date on which CenturyLink begins billing for a Service, as further defined in Billing Section 3.2. \"Service\" means the service provided by CenturyLink through its affiliate, including CenturyLink TS or Tier 3 and\/or their licensors and contractors as set forth on the Service Order or SOW. \"Service Guide\" (or \"SG\") means the product-specific Service guide that includes technical specifications which can be found at http:\/\/www.centurylink.com\/technology\/service-guides, which CenturyLink TS may modify from time to time, effective upon posting on the Web site. \"Service Order\" means a service order request submitted on a form issued by CenturyLink and signed by Customer that includes the type and details of the specific Services ordered by Customer. \"Service Schedule\" means those service descriptions providing additional terms pursuant to which CenturyLink will provide and Customer shall purchase the Services described therein. The applicable Service Schedules are included in this Service Exhibit. \"SLA\" or “SLA Attachment” means the service level agreement applicable to each individual Service, if any, which provides Customer's sole and exclusive remedies for any Service quality or performance deficiencies or failures of any kind (e.g., uptime, latency). To clarify, such sole and exclusive SLA remedies shall not apply to breaches of unrelated obligations under the Agreement such as infringement, confidentiality, etc. CenturyLink may modify SLAs during a renewal term upon 60 days’ notice. 2. Term. Services have a minimum term which begins on the BCD and continues for the period set forth in the relevant Service Order or SOW (\"Initial Service Term\"), at the conclusion of which the Service will automatically renew for successive periods equal to 12 months, unless terminated by either party in writing at least 60 days prior to the expiration of the then-current Service Term. The Initial Service Term and any renewal terms are collectively referred to as the \"Service Term\". 3. Rates; Billing. 3.1 Rates. Customer will pay all applicable rates and fees set forth in the relevant Service Order and\/or SOW. Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary and not more than once per calendar year, CenturyLink may increase the charges applicable to any Service provided hereunder in an amount not to exceed the latest annual increase in the Consumer Price Index, specifically, the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics \"All Items Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) for the U.S. City Average\". Such increase shall be effective upon the date set forth in CenturyLink’s written notice thereof to Customer. CenturyLink may otherwise increase applicable charges as set forth on a particular Service Order or upon prior written notice during any automatic renewal term. 3.2 Billing. The BCD for the Service is the earlier of (i) the date on which Customer uses (except during the Acceptance Period) the Service or (ii) the date CenturyLink notifies Customer in writing that the initial installation or a usable part thereof (such as a data circuit between two points or an individual data center installation on a multi-data center project) is complete. For Professional Services in a SOW, the BCD shall be the date CenturyLink begins performing the Services or as specified in the SOW. Customer shall have three business days after such use or notification to notify CenturyLink of any deficiency (\"Acceptance Period\"). Such notice shall include a written description that specifically demonstrates the deficiency in Service to the reasonable satisfaction of CenturyLink. The Service shall be deemed accepted unless Customer provides CenturyLink with notice to the contrary during the Acceptance Period. Upon timely notice to CenturyLink of a deficiency, CenturyLink will remedy the Service deficiency and provide Customer notification of such remedy at which time a new Acceptance Period shall begin, and CenturyLink will delay billing until accepted in accordance with this provision. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, if CenturyLink partially installs or activates a Service, CenturyLink reserves the right to commence billing for such Service on a pro rata basis. 4. Compliance and Security. Each party shall comply with all laws and regulations applicable to the provision (in the case of CenturyLink) and use (in the case of Customer) of the Services provided hereunder.

Customer and its End Users will not use or access the Services or any data center in a manner that materially interferes with or harms the CenturyLink infrastructure or any third parties; or is tortious or violates any third party right. CenturyLink may suspend the affected Service in the event Customer violates the preceding sentence. CenturyLink will attempt to notify Customer in writing prior to suspending Service; provided, however, CenturyLink may suspend Service without notice if CenturyLink becomes aware of a violation of any applicable law or regulation or of activity that exposes CenturyLink to criminal or civil liability or that exposes the CenturyLink network, CenturyLink property or CenturyLink customers' network or property to harm as identified in the CenturyLink TS AUP. Customer agrees to defend, indemnify and hold CenturyLink harmless from third party claims, losses, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees arising from non-compliance with this section. 6. Termination. Either party may terminate this Service Exhibit or affected Services (i) upon 30 days’ prior written notice for Cause; or (ii) in accordance with any other express term contained in the Agreement. If Customer terminates an ordered Service prior to its BCD, Customer will pay a Cancellation Charge equal to one month's projected MRC, plus all out-of-pocket costs incurred by or imposed upon CenturyLink (e.g., ordered equipment, licenses, carrier termination charges). If the Service or this Agreement is terminated either by CenturyLink for Cause or by Customer for Convenience prior to the conclusion of the applicable Service Term, then Customer shall be liable for a Cancellation Charge equal to: (a) unless otherwise set forth on a Service Order, 50% of the then current MRC for the affected Services multiplied by the number of months remaining in the Service Term; (b) Service charges accrued but unpaid as of the termination date; (c) any NRC discount or waiver granted by CenturyLink, and (d) any out-of-pocket costs incurred by or imposed upon CenturyLink (e.g., ordered equipment, licenses, carrier termination charges).

No Transfer of Undertakings. CenturyLink and Customer agree that the provision and subsequent expiry, cancellation or termination of the Services are not intended to be transfers of undertakings within the meaning of the Transfer of Undertaking (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 and related legislation (\"TUPE\"), and consequently there will be no transfer of employees between Customer and CenturyLink (or any other subsequent service provider of Customer) as a result of the operation of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the above, Customer shall indemnify and hold CenturyLink harmless for any losses, claims, liabilities, awards, damages, costs and expenses (including any fines, legal expenses and costs of settlement) CenturyLink may incur through the operation of TUPE in connection with this Agreement. This provision applies only to Services delivered by CenturyLink in the United Kingdom. 10. Maintenance.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, CenturyLink may increase the rates associated with existing Colocation Service at any time after twelve months of the initial installation date for such Service in order to pass through increases in such Service's underlying power facility costs and such increase shall be effective upon the date set forth in CenturyLink's written notice thereof to Customer. 3. Customer or Customer's employees, agents, contractors, or End Users who access any CenturyLink Premises on Customer's behalf (\"Authorized Representatives\") must be designated in writing. Customer, its Authorized Representatives and all Customer Equipment and any related materials used in connection with the Service shall comply with all CenturyLink data center operating policies (including the \"CenturyLink TS Customer Handbook and Information Guide\" (\"Customer Guide\")), a current copy of which is located on http:\/\/www.savvisstation.com and which CenturyLink may change from time to time. If CenturyLink reasonably believes that Customer is not complying with this section, CenturyLink will notify Customer thereof and Customer shall remedy such non-compliance within 5 days of receiving such notice. If Customer fails to remedy such non-compliance within such period, then, notwithstanding any other rights in the Agreement, CenturyLink may immediately (i) suspend the Service and\/or restrict Customer's access to the CenturyLink Premises for so long as deemed reasonably necessary by CenturyLink or (ii) terminate the affected Service if such non¬ compliance is recurring. CenturyLink may likewise restrict access to the CenturyLink Premises if Customer fails to timely cure any breach of the Agreement. 4. Subject to the rest of this section, CenturyLink may enter the Customer Area and\/or access Customer Equipment only to the extent necessary to provide a Service or otherwise exercise its rights under the Agreement. If Customer Equipment needs to be moved to another area within the same CenturyLink Premises or to another CenturyLink Premises due to either Customer's requirements for additional space or CenturyLink's reasonable business needs, the parties will cooperate to complete and minimize the impact of the relocation. CenturyLink may temporarily store Customer Equipment pending its installation at a CenturyLink Premises (\"Equipment Storage\"). If Equipment Storage continues for more than 30 days, CenturyLink may return, at Customer's expense, the Customer Equipment. The risk of loss or damage for any Customer Equipment during any Equipment Storage shall be upon Customer. If any Authorized Representative or Customer Equipment presents any material risk of harm to CenturyLink, its employees, agents, contractors, or customers, or the CenturyLink Premises, Customer shall take prompt action to eliminate such risk. If Customer fails to do so or if there is risk of material and imminent harm, CenturyLink may, without prior notice or liability to Customer, take appropriate action itself, including accessing the Customer Area. Customer, its Authorized Representatives and Customer Equipment will not cause personal injury or property damage at a CenturyLink Premise. 5. Customer shall within five days of the end of the Service Term: (a) remove all Customer Equipment and any other Customer property (\"Customer Materials\") from the CenturyLink Premises; and (b) return the Customer Area to CenturyLink in the same condition as it was on the BCD, normal wear and tear excepted.

Network Connectivity. 6.1 Hosting Network Infrastructure. The Colocation network infrastructure provides connectivity from Customer’s environments to the available networks within each facility, including the CenturyLink backbone(s), and other Colocation customers or Alternate Carrier Network Connections.

An Alternate Carrier Network Connection is a connection to a non-CenturyLink network. Depending on the particular data center’s configuration, Alternate Carrier Network Connections can be made at either the data center’s carriers’ premises or at the data center’s servicing point of presence. Depending on the data center and alternate carrier availability, the rates and required components may vary. In the event that a carrier of interest to Customer is not available at the data center’s carriers’ premises Customer is encouraged to inform its CenturyLink sales representative or the data center manager so that CenturyLink may inform such carrier of potential demand for carrier’s services which may lead to a CenturyLink agreement with such carrier to establish a presence at the data center. 7. This is a service agreement and does not constitute a lease of any real property or create any tenant or other real property rights. Customer has been granted only a license to occupy the Customer Area and use the CenturyLink Premises and any CenturyLink Equipment in accordance with the Agreement and agrees that this Service Schedule, to the extent it involves the use of NSP #: 120355 Contract Code: 191003 Page 95 of 129 CONFIDENTIAL © CenturyLink, Inc.

If the CenturyLink Premises becomes the subject of a taking by eminent domain by any authority having such power, CenturyLink shall have the right to terminate any or all of the affected Services without liability; provided, however, that CenturyLink will use commercially reasonable efforts to move Customer to another, comparable CenturyLink Premises prior to exercising such termination right. CenturyLink shall have the right to terminate any or all of the Services without liability of any kind on the earlier of (i) the expiration of or earlier termination of CenturyLink's underlying lease for the CenturyLink Premises, or (ii) expiration or earlier termination of this Service Schedule.

CenturyLink QC (“Centurylink”) will provide and Customer will purchase CenturyLink Metro Ethernet (“Service”) under the Agreement, this service exhibit (“Service Exhibit”), and the ISG, and at the locations specified on the pricing attachment. Capitalized terms not defined in this Service Exhibit are defined in the Agreement. Service is subject to Tech Pub 77411 and to the online SLA. 2. Service. 2.1 Description. Metro Ethernet is a flexible transport service that uses established Ethernet transport technology. Metro Ethernet provides connections between multiple Customer locations within a metropolitan area using native Ethernet protocol. The transmission speed depends on the Ethernet port (“Port”) selected and the amount of bandwidth ordered over the Port (“Bandwidth Profile”). Metro Ethernet extends to the Demarcation Point. Service is available over three designs: (a) “Customer Premises,” supporting transmission speeds as low as 1 Mbps and up to 1 Gbps in increments of 10 Mbps from 10 up to 100 Mbps, and in increments of 100 Mbps from 100 up to 1,000 Mbps; (b) “Central Office,” supporting transmission speeds of up to 100 Mbps, 600 Mbps and 1,000 Mbps; and (c) “Ethernet with Extended Transport” (DS3 is required and purchased separately from Metro Ethernet), supporting transmission speeds as low as 5 Mbps and up to 40 Mbps. 2.2 Changes. Customer may add or change Service with a pricing attachment. Subsequent pricing attachments to add or change a Bandwidth Profile, Quality of Service, or Protect Routing to an existing Service Term must be coterminous with the existing Service Term. Subsequent pricing attachments to increase a Metro Ethernet Bandwidth during the Service Term, will not be assessed the Metro Ethernet Port NRC, unless the change in bandwidth requires a higher capacity Metro Ethernet Port that would result in a Metro Ethernet Port NRC; however, the MRC will be changed to the then-current Metro Ethernet Bandwidth Profile Charge specified in the ISG. Customer may subsequently decrease the Metro Ethernet Bandwidth Profile as low as the originally configured bandwidth without being assessed a Termination Charge. If Customer chooses to decrease the Metro Ethernet Bandwidth to a lower bandwidth than originally agreed to before the expiration date of the Service Term, a Termination Charge will apply. 2.3 Moves. Customer requests for a physical move of Service to a new location will be treated as a termination of Service at the original location. NRCs will apply and Minimum Service Period requirements must be met in the new location. If the remainder of the original Service Term is not long enough after the effective date of the move to meet the Minimum Service Period for the moved Service, then Customer must select a new Service Term. Customer requests for a physical move of Service to a location within the same building as the existing Service will be charged a fee equal to one half the applicable NRC charge. 3. Service Term; Termination. 3.1 Service Term. This Service Exhibit will begin on the Effective Date of the Agreement (or an amendment to the Agreement if Customer adds this Service Exhibit after the Effective Date of the Agreement) and will continue until the expiration or termination of the last to expire (or terminate) Service. Each Service ordered, including additions and renewals, will have its own Minimum Service Period (as defined in the Agreement) and “Service Term” as indicated on a pricing attachment. Both Parties agree to begin discussions regarding the renewal or discontinuation of Service 90 days before expiration of a Service Term. If the parties do not reach agreement by expiration of a Service Term, Service will continue under the terms of the Agreement and this Service Exhibit and revert to the then-current month-to-month ISG Rates. 3.2 Termination. (a) Either party may terminate Service or this Service Exhibit in accordance with the Agreement and ISG. Customer will remain liable for charges accrued but unpaid as of the termination date. If, prior to the conclusion of the Service Term, Service or this Service Exhibit is terminated either by CenturyLink for Cause or by Customer for Convenience, then Customer will also be liable for any Termination Charges. (b) If that termination is before the date Service is available for use, the Termination Charge will be those reasonable expenses incurred by CenturyLink through the date of termination including, but not limited to, the standard installation charges for the Service, regardless of any waivers or promotions extended to Customer based on its completion of the Service Term. (c) If that termination is during the Minimum Service Period, Customer will pay a Termination Charge of 100% of the Service MRCs being terminated, including the applicable MRCs multiplied by the number of months remaining in the Minimum Service Period, plus 40% of the MRCs multiplied by the number of months remaining in the Service Term after the Minimum Service Period. (d) If that termination is after the Minimum Service Period, Customer will pay a Termination Charge of 40% of the MRCs multiplied by the number of months remaining in the Service Term. (e) Service is no longer subject to a Termination Charge once it goes month-to-month after the completion of the Service Term. 4. Charges. Current Rates for Service and optional features are set forth in the pricing attachment. At the conclusion of the Service Term, the Service will continue to be subject to the Agreement and this Service Exhibit and the Rates will revert to the then-current month-to-month ISG Rates, unless Service and optional features are renewed for a new Service Term on a pricing attachment via amendment. If Service and optional features are renewed for a new Service Term on a pricing attachment via amendment, the Rates will be those in effect at the time the Service is renewed, as evidenced by CenturyLink’s records. Service is subject to and Customer will pay to CenturyLink all applicable CenturyLink ISG interstate charges. NSP #: 120355 Contract Code: 191003 Page 108 of 129 CONFIDENTIAL © CenturyLink, Inc.

The Time to Notify Goal is measured from the time an Incident is detected by a system-generated alarm (“Initial DDoS Alarm”) to when CenturyLink attempts to verbally notify Customer of the Incident. Customer may request CenturyLink to notify Customer through either a phone call or e-mail. A phone call notification is available for high priority alerts. E-mail notification is available for low, medium and high priority alerts. The Time to Notify Goal applies only to Proactive DDoS Mitigation Service. (b) Time to Mitigate. If Customer has provided all the necessary information to initiate Mitigation, the Time to Mitigate Goal is measured from Customer Approval to the actual initiation of Mitigation. “Customer Approval” means: (i) the time CenturyLink receives verbal permission from Customer to initiate Mitigation or (ii) the Initial DDoS Alarm for Proactive DDoS Mitigation Service if Customer has pre-authorized CenturyLink to initiate Mitigation. If Customer has pre-authorized CenturyLink to initiate Mitigation, but additional countermeasures that were not pre-authorized are required to mitigate the Incident, the verbal permission Time to Mitigate Goal will apply to the additional countermeasures that were not previously pre-authorized. Initiation of Customer pre¬ authorized Mitigation may be done by an authorized CenturyLink employee or as an automated initiation by the system (“Auto- Mitigation”). Customer chooses which mode to use. Description Goal Remedy (Credit is applied as a % of the MRC for the affected Service)\nTime to Notify (Proactive DDoS Mitigation Service only) 15 minutes from Initial DDoS Alarm 16 - 30 minutes = 50% More than 30 minutes = 100%\nTime to Mitigate 15 minutes from Customer’s verbal permission (Verbal permission to begin Mitigation) 16 - 30 minutes = 50% More than 30 minutes = 100%\n15 minutes from Initial DDoS Alarm (Pre-authorized mitigation initiated by CenturyLink employee or Auto-Mitigation) 16 - 30 minutes = 50% More than 30 minutes = 100%\n2. Status Reporting and Change Requests. The following Status Reporting and Change Request objectives are intended to be informational only and do not provide any SLA credits and are not subject to any other Goal in this SLA. (a) Status Reporting. If requested by Customer, CenturyLink will provide Customer with a status report by telephone, or e¬ mail within 60 minutes after the initiation of Mitigation. (b) Change Requests. Customer may request one routine configuration or policy change per 90 day period. CenturyLink will provide the routine configuration and policy change requests within one business day after the request. Customer requests that exceed one request per 90 day period may result in additional charges. A routine change means a change when an attack is not taking place. 3. Maintenance. 3.1 Normal Maintenance. CenturyLink may periodically upgrade software or hardware to maintain the latest versions in operation. If CenturyLink determines an upgrade is necessary, CenturyLink will work with Customer to schedule a time to make necessary changes, preferably during the normally scheduled CenturyLink maintenance window. Customer must allow CenturyLink to make these changes within five business days of receipt of the request from CenturyLink, or CenturyLink’s obligation to provide this Service will be suspended until Customer grants CenturyLink the access CenturyLink requires to make such changes. 3.2 Urgent Maintenance. “Urgent Maintenance” means efforts to correct conditions that require immediate action. Urgent Maintenance may degrade the quality of the Service. Such effects related to Urgent Maintenance will entitle Customer to SLA credits as set forth in this SLA. CenturyLink may undertake Urgent Maintenance at any time deemed necessary and will provide notice of Urgent Maintenance to Customer as soon as is commercially practicable under the circumstances. 4.

In no case will CenturyLink be required to provide duplicate reimbursement or payment to Customer for any Service quality failure incident. Circuit Availability Customer will, subject to the terms, exclusions, and restrictions described herein, be entitled to receive from CenturyLink a credit, as outlined in the Outage Credits section of this SLA, if the availability (“Circuit Availability”) of a circuit for any calendar month falls below the percentage shown in the relevant credit schedule included in this section (“Outage Credit”). The credit schedule provides availability objectives and related remedies. Circuit Availability objectives and related remedies are provided for local access or tail circuits used in connection with the service only if these are on CenturyLink-owned network facilities. The service will for purposes of this SLA be deemed to be unavailable to Customer only if the service on a particular circuit (“Affected Service”) is subject to an interruption (other than noted herein) that results in the total disruption of the service (“Outage”). The credit to which Customer may be entitled under this section will be equal to the applicable percentage of Customer’s monthly recurring charges (“MRC”) for the Affected Service after application of any credits or discounts (“Eligible Service Charges”). The credit will not include credits on any other MRCs charged to Customer for any other service. Circuit Availability is the measure of Service, expressed in percentage, calculated as Total Time minus Outage Time divided by Total Time. For the purpose of this definition, “Total Time” is the number of seconds in a calendar month. “Outage Time” is the time in seconds the service has had an Outage. For protected or Domestic Network Diversity Service, Outage Time includes only the amount of time in seconds that both service paths experience concurrent Outage Time. If at any given time any one of the two paths is available it will not be deemed as Outage Time. 1.

The length of each Outage will be calculated in seconds. An Outage will be deemed to have commenced upon verifiable notification thereof by Customer to CenturyLink, or, when indicated by network control information actually known to CenturyLink network personnel, whichever is earlier. Each Outage will be deemed to terminate upon restoration of the affected Service as evidenced by appropriate network tests by CenturyLink. CenturyLink’s trouble ticketing system will be the governing source of data for calculating Outage Credits. CenturyLink will give notice to Customer of any scheduled outage as early as is practicable, and a scheduled outage will under no circumstances be viewed as an Outage hereunder. 1.4 Outage Credits will not be granted if the malfunction of any Service is due to: (a) Interruptions or times of service degradation during any period in which CenturyLink or its agents are not afforded access to the premises where the access lines associated with Customer’s Service are terminated, provided such access is reasonably necessary to prevent a degradation or to restore service; (b) Interruptions or times of service degradation during any period when CenturyLink has posted on the CenturyLink web site or communicated to Customer in any other manner that Customer’s Service will be unavailable for maintenance or rearrangement purposes, or Customer has released the service to CenturyLink for the installation of a Customer Service order; (c) Interruptions or times of service degradation during any period when Customer elects not to release the Service(s) for testing and\/or repair and continues to use it on an impaired basis; (d) Interruptions or times of service degradation resulting from force majeure events beyond the reasonable control of CenturyLink including, but not limited to, acts of God, government regulation, labor strikes, national emergency, or war (declared or undeclared); (e) Interruptions or times of service degradation resulting from Customer’s use of the Service in an unauthorized or unlawful man ner; (f) Interruptions or times of service degradation resulting from a CenturyLink disconnect for Customer’s breach of a term set forth in the Agreement; (g) Interruptions or times of service degradation resulting from incorrect, incomplete, or inaccurate orders from Customer; (h) Interruptions or times of service degradation due to improper or inaccurate network specifications provided by Customer; (i) Interruptions or times of service degradation resulting from an outage or other defect occurring in Customer’s Interconnection Facilities; or (j) Special configurations of the standard Service that have been mutually agreed to by CenturyLink and Customer; provided, however, CenturyLink may provide a separate service level agreement to Customer for those special configurations. 1.5 To be eligible for Outage Credits under this SLA, Customer must submit necessary supporting documentation and request the Outage Credit within 30 days of the conclusion of the service month in which the Outage arose. All approved Outage Credits will be credited on the next monthly invoice for the affected Service after receipt of Customer’s request for credit and CenturyLink’s approval of the Outage Credit. The total of all Outage Credits applicable to or accruing in any given month will not exceed the amount payable by Customer to CenturyLink for that same month for such Service. 1.6 “Chronic Outage\" for purposes of this SLA, means that over a 30 consecutive day period, Service experiences: (a) more than five outages related to the same issue; or (b) more than 48 aggregate hours of outages. If Customer experiences Chronic Outages with respect to the Service, Customer will be entitled to terminate the affected Service without further obligation by providing CenturyLink with written notice following such Chronic Outages (a “Chronic Circuit Cancellation”). Customer must exercise any termination right available to it under this section within 30 days after Customer first becomes eligible to exercise the applicable termination right.

This SLA applies to Service ordered by CenturyLink’s customer pursuant to an agreement (“Agreement”) with CenturyLink Communications, LLC f\/k\/a Qwest Communications Company, LLC d\/b\/a CenturyLink QCC (“CenturyLink”). On April 1,2014, Qwest Communications Company, LLC completed a name change to CenturyLink Communications, LLC. References in supporting agreements or other documents, to Qwest Communications Company, LLC or its predecessors are replaced with “CenturyLink Communications, LLC.” For Customer’s claims related to Service deficiencies, interruptions or failures, Customer’s exclusive remedies are limited to those remedies set forth in this SLA. 1. Network and Port Components. 1.1 Components. The SLA Goal measurement includes: (a) all network components of the CenturyLink IP network; (b) all network components of the CenturyLink ATM and Frame Relay networks as incorporated into the Service; and (c) CenturyLink Provided Access for the domestic Network Availability and Installation goals only. The CenturyLink IP, ATM, and Frame Relay networks include routers, switches, fiber and any other facilities that are owned by CenturyLink or other providers specifically designated by CenturyLink for international IP service (“International Service Providers”). As defined in this SLA, a “POP” means a CenturyLink point of presence location, as determined by CenturyLink, that represents the provider edge of the CenturyLink IP, ATM or Frame Relay network or an International Service Provider POP. “CenturyLink Provided Access” means local backbone access circuits in the continental U.S. (a) ordered and leased by CenturyLink from another carrier on Customer’s behalf; or (b) provided solely on CenturyLink owned and operated facilities. This includes Special Access, Ethernet Local Access, Frame Partner Access, and ATM Partner Access technologies, as defined in the Local Access Service Exhibit. “Affected Service” means the particular CenturyLink IQ Networking Port that fails to meet the applicable Goal. 1.2 Regions. A list of international regions (including Customer Service Center support information) and corresponding Tiers is appended to this SLA as Attachment 1, located at http:\/\/www.centurylink.com\/legal. 2. Goals. Domestic Regions SLA Components:\nIntra U.S. The CenturyLink IP network within the 48 contiguous U.S. states\nHawaii to U.S. West Coast (“Hawaii”) CenturyLink Trans-Hawaii IP network to the continental U.S. CenturyLink IP network in the Los Angeles Metro Area\nAlaska to U.S. Pacific Northwest (“Alaska”) CenturyLink Trans-Alaska IP network to the continental U.S. CenturyLink IP network in the Seattle Metro Area\n2.1 Domestic Network and Port-Related Goals. The following domestic service level goals (“Goals”) apply to Internet Ports, Private Ports, and Enhanced Ports (collectively, “CenturyLink IQ Networking Ports”) purchased from CenturyLink pursuant to an agreement. If a Bandwidth Tier applies, Goals for CenturyLink IQ Networking Ports only apply to the portion of traffic that is within the contracted Bandwidth Tier and will not apply to the CenturyLink IQ Networking Port bandwidth usage that exceeds the Bandwidth Tier. The Goals associated with Latency, Packet Delivery, Jitter, and Black Hole Filtering are measured using monthly averages from the CenturyLink IP network and apply in the listed regions after the ports have been accepted for use. Individual circuit outages of MLPPP (NxDS1) bundles are not subject to the Network Availability or Reporting Goals. International Goals for Availability, Latency, Packet Delivery, and Jitter are appended to this SLA in Attachment 1. (a) Network Availability. The availability of the Service (“Network Availability”) is measured by “Network Downtime,” which exists when a particular CenturyLink IQ Networking Port of Customer is unable to transmit and receive data. Network Downtime is measured from the time a trouble ticket is opened by CenturyLink in the CenturyLink trouble management system to the time the affected CenturyLink IQ Networking Port is again able to transmit and receive data. Network Availability for ports with Frame Partner Access or ATM Partner Access is only applicable if Customer provides ready access to associated routers for monitoring purposes. Region Goal Remedy (Credit is applied to MRC of the Affected Service)*\nIntra U.S. Hawaii Alaska 100% The first hour of Network Downtime qualifies for a credit of one day’s charges pro-rated from the MRC. Each cumulative half-hour of Network Downtime beyond the first qualifies the Customer for a credit of two day’s charges pro-rated from the MRC.\n(b) Latency. The average network transit delay (“Latency”) will be measured via roundtrip pings on an ongoing basis every five minutes to determine a consistent average monthly performance level for Latency at all the POPs within the region. Latency is calculated as follows: C (Roundtrip Delay for POP-POP trunks) = Latency Total Number of POP-POP trunks Region Goal Remedy (Credit is applied as a % of the MRC for the Affected Service)*\nNorth America\nIntra U.S. 42 ms 43 - 60 ms = 10% 61 - 80 ms = 25% Greater than 80 ms = 50%\nHawaii Alaska 75 ms 76 - 95 ms = 10% 96 -120 ms = 25% Greater than 120 ms = 50%\n*subject to requirements and limitations in Section 4 NSP #: 120355 Contract Code: 191003 Page 122 of 129 CONFIDENTIAL © CenturyLink, Inc.

Packet Delivery will be measured on an ongoing basis every five minutes to determine a consistent average monthly performance level for packets actually delivered between the POPs. (d) Jitter. Jitter is a measurement of the interpacket delay variance and packet loss in the CenturyLink IP network, which is measured by generating synthetic user datagram protocol (UDP) traffic. This Goal does not apply if the Internet Port is used in conjunction with DDoS Mitigation Service. Region Goal Remedy (Credit is applied as a % of the MRC for the Affected Service)*\nIntra U.S. Hawaii Alaska 99.90% 99.01 % - 99.89% = 10% 90% - 99% = 25% Less than 90% = 50%\nRegion Goal Remedy (Credit is applied as a % of the MRC for the Affected Service)*\nIntra U.S. 2 ms 2.1 - 3 ms = 10% 3.1 - 4 ms = 25% Greater than 4 ms = 50%\nHawaii Alaska 4 ms 4.1 - 5 ms = 10% 5.1 - 6 ms = 25% Greater than 6 ms = 50%\n(e) Reporting. The Reporting Goal is measured from the time a Network Downtime trouble ticket is opened to the time CenturyLink reports the Network Downtime to Customer by the agreed upon notification method. This Goal does not apply to Ports that use Ethernet Local Access. Region Goal Remedy (Credit is applied to MRC of the Affected Service)*\nIntra U.S. Hawaii Alaska 10 minutes Each failure to meet the Goal qualifies Customer for a credit of one day’s charges pro-rated from the MRC, at a maximum of one such credit accrued per day.\n(f) Installation. The Installation Goal measures the installation times for CenturyLink Provided Access ordered in conjunction with CenturyLink IQ Networking Ports only. The Installation Goal only applies if there are existing CenturyLink facilities in the location that supports the Affected Service. Installation is measured from the date CenturyLink Engineering accepts the CenturyLink Provided Access order. If Customer has a designated Key Port, the applicable Installation Goal shown below will apply to that Key Port, and the installation of related non-Key Ports will occur the later of: (i) within 10 business days after that Key Port’s Start of Service Date; or (ii) within the normal Installation Goal for that Port, as measured from the date CenturyLink Engineering accepts the order. If no Key Port is designated, CenturyLink will follow normal installation intervals without special sequencing. Region Goal Remedy (Credit is applied to MRC of the Affected Service)*\nIntra U.S. DS-1 22 business days Each failure to meet the Goal qualifies Customer for a credit of one day’s charges pro-rated from the MRC for each day beyond the applicable Goal until the CenturyLink Provided Access is installed, for a maximum of 15 days’ charges.\nDS-3 OC-3 OC-12 33 business days\nEthernet 10 - 1000 Mbps 66 business days\nHawaii Alaska DS-1 22 business days Each failure to meet the Goal qualifies Customer for a credit of one day’s charges pro-rated from the MRC for each day beyond the applicable Goal until the CenturyLink Provided Access is installed, for a maximum of 15 days’ charges.\nDS-3 OC-3 OC-12 43 business days\n(g) Black Hole Filtering. Once a suspected Distributed Denial of Service (“D\/DoS”) attack is determined to be valid, the Black Hole Filtering Goal is measured from the time CenturyLink receives permission and all necessary information from Customer to implement a null-route and the actual placement of a null-route on the affected destination IP address. The Black Hole Filtering Goal is only applicable to Internet Ports and the Internet Port portion of Enhanced Ports. Region Goal Remedy (Credit is applied to MRC of the Affected Service)*\nIntra U.S. Hawaii Alaska 15 minutes Failure to implement a null routing within the Goal qualifies Customer for one day’s charges pro-rated from the MRC of the Port of the Affected Service, up to a maximum of one such credit accrued per day.\n3. Maintenance. 3.1 Network Normal Maintenance. “Normal Maintenance” means upgrades of hardware or software or upgrades to increase capacity. Normal Maintenance may temporarily degrade the quality of the Service, including possible outages. \"Local Time” means the local tim e in the time zone in which an Affected Service is located. CenturyLink may change the maintenance window times upon posting to the website or other notice to Customer. CenturyLink will undertake Normal Maintenance during the hours and upon the prior notice time period stated below. International Maintenance hours are located in Attachment 1 to this SLA. Region Normal Maintenance Hours Prior Notice\nIntra U.S. Hawaii Alaska Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday mornings between the hours of 12:00 AM and 6:00 AM Local Time 10 business days\n3.2 Network Urgent Maintenance. “Urgent Maintenance” means efforts to correct network conditions that are likely to cause a material Service outage and that require immediate action. Urgent Maintenance may degrade the quality of the Services, including possible outages. Such effects related to Urgent Maintenance will entitle Customer to service credits as set forth in this SLA. CenturyLink may undertake Urgent Maintenance at any time deemed necessary and will provide notice of Urgent Maintenance to Customer as soon as is commercially practicable under the circumstances.

Capitalized terms not defined n this SLA are defined n the Agreement. This SLA will not apply to Approved Connectivity. The CenturyLink IQ™ Networking SLA applies to such Approved Connectivity, and is available for review at http:\/\/qwest.centurylink.com\/legal\/sla.html. This SLA is effective as of the first day of the second month after initial installation of Service. VOICE AVAILABILITY: Voice Availability is based on \"Voice Platform Downtime,” which exists when a particular SIP Trunk Flat Rate Session is unable to transmit inbound and\/or outbound voice calls. Such failure is recorded in the CenturyLink IP Network trouble ticket system. Voice Platform Downtime is measured from the time a master trouble ticket is opened in the CenturyLink trouble management system to the time the Affected Service is able to transmit inbound and outbound voice calls. In order to qualify for credits, the outage must be deemed a \"Major Service Outage,” which is defined as a service outage network condition causing major service disruption to the customer base relative to a network segment for which a master trouble ticket is opened, and which impacts more than one customer. This Voice Availability SLA does not apply to call quality. Subject to the foregoing limitations, each time Voice Availability is less than CenturyLink's 100% availability goal, Customer qualifies for a percentage credit as shown in the table below, prorated from the Session and TN MRC of the Affected Service, up to the maximums indicated in the Remedies section Goal Voice Platform Downtime Amount of Monthly Bill Credit\n100% 10 to 30 minutes 1 day's credit\n31 to 60 minutes 4 days' credit\n61 to 120 minutes 8 days' credit\n121 to 240 minutes 12 days' credit\nOver 241 minutes 18 days' credit\nNETWORK AVAILABILITY Network Availability is based on \"Network Downtime,” which exists when an individual customer's SIP Trunk Flat Rate Sessions are unable to transmit inbound and\/or outbound voice calls as a result of a CenturyLink network event. Such failure is recorded in the CenturyLink VoIP Network trouble ticket system. Network Downtime is measured from the time the trouble ticket is opened in the CenturyLink trouble management system to the time the affected SIP Trunk Flat Rate Sessions service is again able to transmit inbound and\/or outbound calls. This SLA does not cover anything on the Customer's side of the external demarcation point (e.g. Customer's data network, CPE (including CPE purchased, leased or rented from CenturyLink), extended wiring, and inside wiring) or other equipment at the Customer address. Goal Remedy\n100% Each cumulative hour of Network Availability less than 100% qualifies Customer for one day's charges pro-rated from the Session and TN MRCs of the Affected Service.\nRemedies. To be eligible for service credits under this SLA, Customer must be in good standing with CenturyLink and current in its obligations. To receive service credits, Customer must contact either their CenturyLink account representative or CenturyLink Billing Inquiries at 1-800-860¬ 1020 to request the credit and open a trouble ticket. Such requests must be made within thirty (30) calendar days from the date when the relevant SLA goal was not met. A credit will be applied only to the month in which the event giving rise to the credit occurred. \"Affected Service” refers to the particular SIP Trunk Flat Rate Session that fails to meet the Voice Availability or Network Availability goal. The total in the aggregate of all credits issued in one month will not exceed the equivalent of 100% of the relevant MRCs for the Affected Service. The maximum credits given for a specific outage will not exceed ten (10) days' credit. Service Credit Exceptions. Service credits will not be issued where the SLA is not met as a result of: (a) the acts or omissions of Customer, its employees, contractors or agents or its End Users; (b) the failure or malfunction of equipment, applications or systems not owned or controlled by CenturyLink; (c) Force Majeure Events; (d) scheduled service maintenance, alteration or implementation; (e) the unavailability of required Customer personnel, including as a result of failure to provide CenturyLink with accurate, current contact information; (f) Customer's failure to use Approved Connectivity, and Customer's failure to provide CenturyLink with remote and\/or on-site access to CPE upon request, including router logon IDs and passwords; (g) Customer's failure to release the Service for testing or repair and continuing to use the Service on an impaired basis; (h) CenturyLink's termination of Service for Cause or Customer's use of Service in an unauthorized or unlawful manner; or (i) improper or inaccurate network specifications provided by Customer. Maintenance Window Definition. Maintenance will be classified as one of the following two types: Normal Maintenance. \"Normal Maintenance” refers to upgrades of hardware or software or upgrades to increase capacity. Normal Maintenance may temporarily degrade the quality of the Service, including possible outages. Such effects related to Normal Maintenance will not give rise to service credits under this SLA. Normal Maintenance will be undertaken between the hours of 11:00 PM and 6:00 AM Local Time. For purposes of this SLA, \"Local Time” means the local time in the time zone in which an Affected Service is located. Urgent Maintenance. \"Urgent Maintenance” refers to efforts to correct network conditions that are likely to cause a material Service outage and that require immediate action. Urgent Maintenance may degrade the quality of the Service, including possible outages. Such effects related to Urgent Maintenance will entitle Customer to service credits as set forth in this SLA. CenturyLink may undertake Urgent Maintenance at any time deemed necessary and will provide notice of Urgent Maintenance to Customer as soon as is commercially practicable under the circumstances. Customer Termination Rights. Customer may terminate the Affected Services without incurring a Cancellation Charge in the event Customer becomes entitled to terminate the Approved Connectivity over which Service is provided due to CenturyLink's failure to meet the CenturyLink IQ Networking SLA. Such termination must be conducted by written notice to the CenturyLink Dublin Service Center, with a courtesy copy to the attention of CenturyLink's General Counsel, and within five business days following the end of the relevant calendar month. Such termination will be effective 45 days after receipt of written notice by CenturyLink. NSP #: 120355 Contract Code: 191003 Page 125 of 129 CONFIDENTIAL © CenturyLink, Inc.

On April 1, 2014, Qwest Communications Company, LLC completed a name change to CenturyLink Communications, LLC. References in supporting agreements or other documents, to Qwest Communications Company, LLC or its predecessors are replaced with “CenturyLink Communications, LLC.” Service is available in DS-1, DS-3, OC-3, OC-12 and OC-48 circuit types. Service terminates at the Service Address’s common telecommunications facility or meet-me point. This SLA does not apply to local access circuits that are provided by another carrier. 1. Definitions “Calendar Month” refers to the period beginning at 12:00 midnight on the first day of a month and ending at 11:59 PM on the last day of that month. “Customer” is a customer that orders the Service from CenturyLink pursuant to an agreement. “CenturyLink Domestic Network” is the network located within those areas in the 48 contiguous United States of America and District of Columbia where CenturyLink is legally permitted to provide the Service to Customer and is comprised only of CenturyLink Facilities. “Service Address” is the building where Customer receives the On-Net Local Access Service. Only a building that is classified by CenturyLink as a business address can be a Service Address. 2. Availability Objective CenturyLink offers the following SLA for Service with a minimum one year Service term. The SLA is effective as of the first day of the second month after initial installation and Customer acceptance of Service. Customer will, subject to the terms, exclusions, and restrictions described in this SLA, be entitled to receive from CenturyLink a credit if the availability (“Circuit Availability”) of a particular Circuit for any Calendar Month falls below the percentage shown in the applicable credit schedule included in this section. CenturyLink guarantees the Circuit Availability only to the point to which CenturyLink can perform remote loop back testing, even if the demarcation point extends past such point. The Service will for purposes of this document be deemed to be unavailable to Customer only if the Circuit (“Affected Circuit”) is subject to an interruption (other than as noted in this SLA) that results in the total disruption of the Service (“Outage”). The credit (“Outage Credit”) to which Customer may be entitled under this section will be equal to the applicable credit percentage identified in the table below of Customer’s monthly recurring charges (“MRCs”) for the Affected Circuit after application of any credits or discounts (“Eligible Circuit Charges”). The Outage Credit will not include credits on any other MRCs charged to Customer for any other service. Circuit Availability Percentage is calculated as follows: (Applicable Days in Calendar Month x 24 x 60) - (Minutes of Outage on Affected Circuit in Calendar Month) (Applicable Days in Calendar Month x 24 x 60) x 100 For purposes of measuring Customer’s Circuit Availability, the CenturyLink Trouble Management System determines the number of minutes of an Outage. An Outage will be deemed to commence upon verifiable notification thereof by Customer to the CenturyLink Trouble Management System, and CenturyLink’s issuance of a trouble ticket. An Outage will conclude upon the restoration of t he Affected Circuit as evidenced by the appropriate network tests conducted by CenturyLink.

A Circuit suffers from chronic Outages if such Circuit, measured over any Calendar Month, experiences more than five Outages, or more than 48 aggregate hours of Outages. Customer may as its sole and exclusive remedy for chronic Outages, upon 30 days prior written notice to CenturyLink, terminate the Affected Circuit without incurring any early termination charges associated with that Affected Circuit except for all usage charges accrued to the date of termination. Customer must exercise any termination right available to it under this section within 30 days after Customer first becomes eligible to exercise the termination right. In the event Customer fails to comply with the condition set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, Customer will, with respect to the termination right, have waived its right to such termination right. 3.

Outage Credits for any Calendar Month must exceed $25.00 to be processed. In no case will CenturyLink provide credit to Customer for an Affected Circuit that exceeds the monthly recurring charge or the stated applicable maximum credit percentage.

Inc (\"Supplier\") Dated: 24 October 2018 (Version: 22 April 2016) r SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT FOR THE PROVISION OF RECRUITMENT SERVICES INTRODUCTION The purpose of this Agreement is to provide a clear understanding of the commitments of the Supplier and FIS to ensure the provision of consistent and timely recruitment services to FIS division in the Asia Pacific region in accordance with the terms and conditions set out below. Definitions: In this Agreement the following definitions apply: • Affiliate whether capitalized or not, means, with respect to a specified person, any person which directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the specified person, for as long as such relationship remains in effect. • Candidate means the person introduced by the Supplier to FIS • Hiring Manager means the individual manager at FIS or its affiliate requiring a vacancy to be filled. • PeopleFluent means the applicant tracking system FIS uses. • Resourcing Manager means the point of contact within the FIS \"Talent Acquisition Team\" • Services mean the recruitment services to be provided by the Supplier to FIS under the terms of this Agreement. FIS will review all agent terms and performance on an annual basis. For the avoidance of any doubt, this Agreement covers the recruitment of staff for FIS' Financial Systems division in the Asia Pacific region only. 1. NOTIFICATION OF A VACANCY BY FIS 1.1 Vacancies will be emailed via PeopleFluent to the Supplier notifying the Supplier of the new vacancy. 1.2 The vacancy specification will contain at a minimum the following information: 12 1 job title and reference number; 1.2.2 an overview of the job content or role; 1.2.3 essential skills required for the role; and 1.2.3 the job location. 1.3 The Supplier will have the opportunity to review the vacancy specification and ask the relevant Resourcing Manager (not the Hiring Manager) questions if further information is required. Where possible and only if necessary, FIS will arrange a briefing call for the Supplier's account manager with the Hinng Manager and the Resourcing Manager who is managing the vacancy. 2 I •t -. SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT FOR THE PROVISION OF RECRUITMENT SERVICES 2. SUPPLIER RESPONSE 2.1 Supplier will pre-screen Candidates before forwarding their details to FIS. As a minimum the Supplier should identify and submit via PeopleFluent the following: 2.1.1 current salary and package details of the Candidate, as well as (i) expected salary, and (ii) the Candidate’s notice period or availability to join FIS. This information should be, to the best of the Supplier's knowledge, accurate and current; 2.1.2 education level and achievement relevant to the role applied for; 2.1.3 chronology of CV; and 2.1.4 career history. 2.2 The Supplier shall verify the Candidate's eligibility to work. If copies of qualifications, confirmation of security clearance or eligibility to apply for clearance are required, these will be requested at offer stage. For the avoidance of doubt, Supplier shall not be required to verify the authenticity of such documentation. 2.3 Supplier shall ensure that Candidates whose applications are submitted have been spoken to specifically regarding FIS and supplied with the vacancy reference number and job description via email. 2.4 Supplier shall provide to FIS regular reports on all Candidates submitted for each vacancy for the purposes of equal opportunities monitoring. FIS will supply the relevant template for such reports. FIS' use of this data could be for up to 12 months from the date of supply. Supplier shall obtain the consent of Candidates for such use of data. 2.5 Suppliers shall, if advertising for candidates, ensure that a statement is included to say that FIS is an Equal Opportunities Employer, 2.6 if applications have not been supplied within 5 working days the Supplier will contact the relevant Resourcing Manager with an indication of how long they think the vacancy will take to fill and provide feedback on why the vacancy is proving difficult to fill. 2.7 All applications must be submitted via PeopleFluent or they will not be considered and the Supplier will not have any eligibility for payment. 3. OWNERSHIP AND DUPLICATION OF SUBMISSIONS 3.1 The Supplier will maintain ownership of Candidates for a period of 6 months following the introduction of the Candidate to FIS. On the engagement of a Candidate for any position within this time frame, a fee will be payable to the Supplier in accordance with Clause 7. After the 6 month period has elapsed, the Supplier will no longer hold ownership of that Candidate. 3 I SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT FOR THE PROVISION OF RECRUITMENT SERVICES 3.2 Notwithstanding Clause 3.1, Candidates who apply to or are canvassed, solicited or approached directly by FIS shall remain under the FIS ownership for a period of 6 months from the date of introduction and until such time as there has been no contact between FIS and the Candidate for a period of 3 months. 3.3 At any time after the periods set out in Clauses 3.1 and 3.2 have expired, the Supplier may re-introduce the Candidate to FIS. 3.4 In the event another supplier submits an application for the same Candidate as the Supplier, the supplier who submitted their application first, as evidenced by the time and date receipt of applications in PeopleFluent, shall own the Candidate. However, in the event of a dispute in relation to the submission of a Candidate, the Regional Resourcing Lead APAC will make the final decision, Any pre-notification of Candidates via telephone, email or any other means will not be taken into consideration should a dispute arise. 3.5 A Candidate will only be considered for the vacancy for which they have been submitted. Therefore, if a Candidate is suitable for more than one vacancy they will need to be submitted for each relevant position. If FIS decides that a Candidate is suitable for a vacancy to which they have not been submitted, and the Candidate is still under the ownership of the Supplier, the Supplier will be informed by the relevant Resourcing Manager. 3.6 For the avoidance of doubt, FIS will not pay any placement fees in respect of candidates speculatively introduced by the Agency. 4. PROCEDURE FOR FEEDBACK 4.1 FIS will endeavour to provide the following to the Supplier on a timely basis: 4.1.1 Feedback on submitted Candidate CVs. If this is not possible the Resourcing Manager will advise Supplier. 4.1.2 Feedback by the Resourcing Manager following the Candidate interview. 4.2 When rejecting a Candidate, the Supplier will be responsible for informing the Candidate either by phone or by e-mail of such decision on behalf of FIS. This communication must be made to unsuccessful Candidates within 24 hours of FIS' confirmation of rejection. 4.3 Where a Candidate is successful, from acceptance to start date, the Supplier shall maintain close communication with the Candidates to ensure a smooth transition and placement. 5. PLACEMENTS 5.1 FIS will satisfy itself as to the suitability of the Candidate and shall take up any references provided by the Candidate and\/or the Supplier. If requested, the Supplier shall assist with obtaining references for a Candidate. 5.2 FIS will be responsible for obtaining work and other permits if required. 4 I SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT FOR THE PROVISION OF RECRUITMENT SERVICES 6. STANDARD OF SERVICES\/ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT 6.1 Supplier warrants, represents and undertakes to FIS that: 6.1.1 it shall deliver the Services in an expeditious, competent and professional manner using appropriately skilled, experienced and qualified recruitment consultants; 6.1.2 it shall deliver the Services to the standards of a first class provider of such services in accordance with standards, practices, methods and procedures and the exercise of a degree of skill and care, diligence, prudence and foresight which would reasonably and ordinarily be expected from a skilled and experienced person engaged in a similar type of undertaking under the same or similar circumstances; and 6.1.3 it shall not, and it shall procure that its employees and consultants shall not, make any statement orally or in writing, publicly or privately or do any act or otherwise conduct itself in such a manner as will or may in the reasonable opinion of FIS disparage FIS or any FIS affiliates. 6.2 Supplier shall notify FIS immediately should any changes be made to the Supplier's account management structure, which may have an effect on the Services being provided to FIS. These changes should be notified to the Resourcing Manager in the first instance. 6.3 The Supplier must promptly notify the Resourcing Manager if a FIS employee, outside of the Asia Pacific Resourcing team, contacts them directly to engage with them regarding a new opening. FEE STRUCTURE 7.1 In consideration of Supplier providing the Services described hereunder, in respect of a successful Candidate employed on a permanent basis (that is, a placement), FIS shall (or shall procure that the FIS affiliate hiring the Candidate shall) pay to Supplier a placement fee equivalent to a percentage of a Candidate's basic annual salary only. For details of this percentage please refer to Appendix 1. A placement is deemed to be made on the Candidate's first working day. Any additional compensation or potential compensation including, but not limited to, benefits, variable pay, commission and bonuses will not be considered when calculating the placement fee. The fee is payable on a success basis only and no retainer payments will be made. 5 I SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT FOR THE PROVISION OF RECRUITMENT SERVICES 7.2 If the Candidate is currently working for FIS on a temporary\/contract basis through the Supplier, the permanent placement fee for such Candidate will be discounted based on the duration that the Candidate has been working for FIS as follows: Period (complete months) % discount on permanent placement fee\n0-3 0\n3-6 25\n6-9 50\n9-12 75\n12 months+ 100 - No fee applicable\nFor the avoidance of doubt, no placement fee shall be payable in the event that a Candidate has been working for FIS for a period of time in excess of 52 calendar weeks. 7.3 For fixed term contracts FIS will pay a percentage of pro-rated salary up to the equivalent of a permanent hire. For example, if FIS hire a Candidate on a 6 month fixed term contract, FIS will pay the Supplier the corresponding fee rate (see Appendix 1) of 0.5 basic annual salary. If the candidate is then employed on a permanent basis, FIS will pay for the remaining 6 months' work to coincide with a standard permanent hire. 7.4 FIS at its sole discretion may decide to pay a premium for some difficult to fill roles; Supplier will be notified in these circumstances. 7.5 If the Candidate's employment terminates before the expiry of 3 calendar months (except where the Candidate is being made redundant) the placement fee will be rebated in accordance with the following scale of rebate; • Candidate leaves within 3 months of commencement; 100% In addition if a Candidate fails their background checking there will be 100% rebate owed to FIS. 7.6 Rebates will be payable provided FIS has notified the Supplier via email within 21 days of the termination of employment of the Candidate concerned. 7.7 The fees set forth in this Clause 7 and Appendix 1 shall not be subject to adjustment or increase without the prior written agreement of FIS, and FIS shall be under no obligation to pay any additional cost of such adjustment or increase if such is included in Supplier's invoice for the Services. 6 I ( ! SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT FOR THE PROVISION OF RECRUITMENT SERVICES 8. EXPENSES 8.1 FIS will not be liable for any expenses incurred by the Supplier in providing the Services to FIS. FIS will only be liable for the cost of the placement fee upon the successful placement of a Candidate. The Supplier will be liable for all costs it incurs in providing the Services to FIS under this Agreement including without limitation; advertising, marketing and pre-approved travel expenses for Candidates, unless otherwise agreed in writing between Supplier and FIS. 9. NON-SOLICITATION OF FIS EMPLOYEES 9.1 Supplier acknowledges that if Supplier were to solicit or entice away from FIS and\/or its affiliates any employee of FIS or a FIS affiliate then FIS and\/or its affiliates would incur substantial time and money in hiring and training replacement(s) for those FIS employees. Accordingly, if Supplier, directly or indirectly, whether on its own behalf or on behalf of another person, company or agency solicits or entices away any employee of FIS or a FIS affiliate during the term of this Agreement or during the six months immediately following termination of this Agreement, Supplier shall pay to FIS liquidated damages in an amount equal to 12 months of such employee's basic salary at the time of leaving his\/her employment with FIS. 10.

BMC Roles and Responsibilities BMC Software recognizes technical support of its products as a cornerstone of our business. Using the policies and procedures below, BMC will provide support services including, but not limited to, phone center support, problem workaround and resolution, incident tracking, problem escalation, and workaround\/fix distribution. As detailed below, BMC will also provide an escalation path for problems originated by its Resellers or its Resellers' customers. Reseller Roles and Responsibilities Resellers may provide support to their customers defined as both internal Alltel users and those customers who sublicense BMC Software from Alltel and earn a royalty for doing so (support services royalties are shown below). For those resellers providing support, BMC expects the following to be provided: Level 1 Support - will include but not be limited to the following tasks: • Acquire customer profile information • Document customer environments • Identify, gather and document problem symptoms • Provide software usage support and software installation assistance • Identify existing bugs and assist in shipping fixes • Provide existing fix information • Escalate incidents as per the documented path • Communicate customer issues\/status information • Provide input to BMC on documentation issues • Maintain timely, complete and accurate problem status data Level 2 Support - will include but not be limited to the following tasks: • Problem verification\/replication • Perform all aspects of problem resolution where capable • Proficiency with all aspects of the product and systems operation • Troubleshoot and debug where appropriate • Non-code fix problem resolution • Provide customized workarounds • Provide and communicate information not included in documentation • Escalate incidents as per the documented path • Maintain timely, complete and accurate problem status data Support Contacts and Problem Tracking SUPPORT ADDENDUM TO BMC - SI LICENSE AGREEMENT PAGE 1 OF 5 ALLTEL. Information Srrv !>-#•<, Reseller shall designate 2 employees as technical support contacts (or such greater number as may be contractually-specified). Each contact person may telephone for problem resolution during BMC- published support hours corresponding to the level of support fees paid. BMC will provide a point of contact (BMC Customer Support Center) within the support and engineering organizations. This contact will be available to assist Reseller support personnel at all times with questions related to product functionality and resolution of customer technical issues. All incidents will be logged into BMC's problem tracking system and an attempt will be made to directly route the call to a technical specialist. Otherwise, it will be queued and handled in accordance to the severity schedule described the table below. Support Period BMC will support each release for a period that commences upon the date Reseller receives notice and expires 180 days after the shipment of the next UPDATE (hereafter called \"Support Period\"). During the Support Period for each release, problems therein shall be corrected in accordance with the severity codes and procedures set forth below. After the expiration of the Support Period for a specific release, problems discovered which are also reproducible on the then current UPDATE, shall be corrected in accordance with the severity codes and procedures set forth below. Those problems which are not reproducible on the then current UPDATE shall be addressed at a negotiated custom services rate, within a reasonable time after written notification is received from the Reseller. Escalation Levels and Response Times Support response and repair times are determined by the severity of an error. CRITICAL and SERIOUS errors, levels 1 and 2 errors respectively, make the product non-functional. NORMAL and LOW errors do not stop production but are deviations from stated product functionality. These are referred to as severity levels 3 and 4. Severity of problems will be established by BMC in accordance with the table below. For this agreement, CSC refers to BMC Customer Support Center. Also, BMC \"business hours\" refers to Monday through Friday, 7 AM Central Time through 7 PM Central Time. All intervals specified in this section reflect business, not calendar days. ALLTEL Service SUPPORT ADDENDUM TO BMC - SI LICENSE AGREEMENT PAGE 2 OF 5 Problem Severity BMC Support Response\nCRITICAL: Severity 1 System or major application is down or seriously impacted and there is no reasonable workaround currently available, (e.g., system crashes or panics, corrupted data captured) BMC confirms receipt of problem description within 4 business hours. BMC will provide best effort for work-around or fix within 48 hours, if the problem is reproducible. Depending on the level of Support Contract purchased, BMC will provide, a technical support contact who is on-call via the CSC 24 hours per day.\nSERIOUS: Severity 2 System or application is moderately impacted. There is no workaround currently available or the workaround is cumbersome to utilize. BMC confirms receipt of problem description within 4 business hours. BMC shall provide best effort to Reseller with work-around or fix within 7 business days. Depending on the level of Support Contract purchased, BMC will provide, a technical support contact who is on-call via the CSC 24 hours per day.\nNORMAL: Severity 3 System or application feature failure, convenient work-around exists. BMC confirms receipt of problem description within 8 business hours. BMC will provide work-around within 5 business days and incorporate fix in future release of software, if agreed by BMC and Reseller. Depending on the level of Support Contract purchased, BMC will provide, a technical support contact who is on-call via the CSC 24 hours per day.\nLOW: Severity 4 Functionality does not match documented specifications. BMC confirms receipt of problem description within 8 business hours. Resolution of problem will appear in future release of BMC software, as agreed to by BMC and Reseller. Depending on the level of Support Contract purchased, BMC will provide, a technical support contact who is on-call via the CSC 24 hours per day.\nBMC will determine if fixes to Severity 1, 2, and 3 problems will be incorporated in next maintenance release. Incident Escalation Policy Reseller associates an escalation priority to all the incidents that are brought to the attention of Reseller technical contacts by either internal or end user sources. These priorities are defined by the Reseller's own software escalation policy. BMC support personnel will respond to the specific problems according to the criteria outlined in that policy. Once reported to the CSC, incident severity levels as defined above govern BMC's problem escalation policy. SUPPORT ADDENDUM TO BMC - SI LICENSE AGREEMENT PAGE 3 OF 5 ALLTEL Informatioi For Severity Levels 1 and 2, if BMC is unable to provide a workaround or temporary fix in the time period specified, Reseller may request that BMC make an on-site trip to the customer's premise in conjunction with a Reseller representative, to troubleshoot and resolve a problem. If the problem is determined to be outside of BMC's product, the expense of the trip and appropriate fees will be paid by Reseller.

SCOPE: This Software License Agreement (the \"Agreement\") establishes the terms and conditions to which the undersigned LICENSOR and LICENSEE (the \"Parties\") have agreed for the licensing of LICENSOR'S software products, support and accompanying documentation (the \"PRODUCT(S)\"). This Agreement contemplates the contemporaneous and future execution by the Parties of one or more ordering documents (the \"PRODUCT ORDER FORM(S)\"), which shall be attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference. Each PRODUCT ORDER FORM shall be considered a separate license (\"License\") conferring upon LICENSEE permission to use the PRODUCT(S) as specified herein. LICENSOR shall be under no obligation to issue or accept any PRODUCT ORDER FORM under this Agreement. No PRODUCT(S) shall be furnished to LICENSEE by virtue of this Agreement alone but shall require the issuance of a PRODUCT ORDER FORM. PRODUCT ORDER FORM(S) shall reference this Agreement and contain, among other items, the: (1) Product Description; (2) Unit Cost; (3) Product Effective Date; (4) DESIGNATED CPU information; (5) Location of CPU(S); (6) Tier Level; and (7) signatures of authorized representatives of both Parties. 2.

TERM: Upon acceptance by LICENSOR, this Agreement shall be effective on the date first written above. Each PRODUCT(S) shall become effective on the date set forth in the PRODUCT ORDER FORM (the ‘Product Effective Date\"). 4. TERMINATION: Either Party may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days written notice to the other Party. LICENSOR may immediately terminate all Licenses without further obligation or liability (a) if LICENSEE fails to pay an amount due hereunder and continues to be delinquent for a period of thirty (30) days after the last day on which payment is due; or (b) if a petition alleging insolvency is filed by or against LICENSEE, or a receiver is appointed for any part of LICENSEE'S business, or its assets are assigned for the benefit of creditors; or (c) if LICENSEE commits any other breach of this Agreement and fails to remedy such breach within thirty (30) days after written notice by LICENSOR of such breach; or (d) if LICENSEE violates Article 6 herein. The termination of this Agreement shall not affect: (i) the obligation of either Party pursuant to any License which has not been terminated, and which shall remain in effect; or (ii) the survival of the representations, warranties and covenants contained herein. Upon the termination of any License, LICENSEE shall return to LICENSOR the terminated PRODUCT(S) and all related documentation, and copies thereof, but may retain all other licensed PRODUCT(S) not terminated.

This Agreement amends, restates, and supersedes that certain Amended and Restated Data Center Services Agreement by and between the parties dated as of January 1, 2017 (the “2017 Agreement”) in its entirety. 1. Introduction. Client retains BKFTS to be a provider of the services (\"Services\") identified in Schedule A hereto, which is incorporated by reference herein and made a part hereof, in accordance with the directives and requirements set forth on Schedule A (“Specifications”). 2. Term and Termination. The term of this Agreement (the \"Term\") shall commence on the Effective Date and expire on June 30, 2019, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms hereof. Any extension to this Agreement will be subject to renegotiation of the provisions and fees contained herein. Subject to section 4.1, either party may terminate this Agreement at any time by giving the other party not less than ninety (90) days prior written notice. In addition, either party may terminate this Agreement or any Schedule hereunder immediately if the other party (i) is the subject of a dissolution, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or bankruptcy action that is not dismissed within forty-five (45) days of being filed; (ii) suffers the appointment of a receiver, conservator or trustee; (iii) commits any act related to this Agreement with the intent to defraud the other party; or (iv) discontinues performance under this Agreement because of a binding order of a court or regulatory body. 3. Services. 3.1 BKFTS shall: (i) provide Client with access to and use of the Services in accordance with the Specifications; and (ii) perform the Services in compliance with all laws applicable to third party providers of the Services. BKFTS warrants that all Services shall be timely performed in a workmanlike and professional manner, in accordance with the applicable Specifications and all applicable industry standards, and by employees or agents of BKFTS having a level of skill commensurate with the requirements of the Services to be performed. BKFTS shall timely provide Client with the reporting associated with the Services, in the form and at the intervals described in Schedule A (as such reporting may be amended from time upon mutual agreement between the parties). 3.2 Client shall be solely responsible for the transmission of any information, data, records or documents (collectively, “Data”) necessary for BKFTS to perform the Services at Client’s expense, and shall bear any risk of loss resulting from that transmission until BKFTS confirms receipt. BKFTS shall bear the risk of loss resulting from Data transmitted to Client until Client confirms receipt. 3.3 Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, BKFTS shall cooperate and use commercially reasonable efforts to assist Client in the transition of the Services to Client or to a replacement service provider and, if requested by Client, perform ancillary services for the applicable fees. 4. Fees and Other Charges. 4.1 As consideration for its performance of the Services, Client shall pay to BKFTS a monthly fee as set forth in Schedule B. which is incorporated by reference herein and made a part hereof (collectively, the “Fees”). Additionally, on or before December 31, 2018, Client must provide to BKFTS written confirmation that Client will no longer require the Services after June 30, 2019. In the event Client fails to provide such notice by December 31, 2018, Client shall pay to BKFTS, in addition to the monthly fee described above, the monthly Penalty Fee described in Section 6(b) of Schedule B hereto for the remaining term of the Agreement. Furthermore, in the event that Client provides such written confirmation to BKFTS on or before December 31, 2018, but subsequently determines that it will require the Services after June 30, 2019, Client shall notify BKFTS of its continued need for the Services, and shall pay to BKFTS the monthly Penalty Fee for the remaining term of the Agreement. In addition, at the time Client notifies BKFTS of its continued need for the Services, Client shall pay to BKFTS a lump sum equal to any Penalty Fee which would have been due prior to the date on which such written notification was given. 4.2 Unless otherwise agreed between the parties, all amounts owing to BKFTS under this Agreement are due within 30 days of issuance of an invoice for Services rendered. Client shall advise BKFTS in writing within 15 days of the date of any invoice if it has any objections to the invoice. Objections to an invoice must include the specific amount disputed and shall provide reasonable detail regarding the basis for the dispute. Raising an objection to a portion of an invoice does not relieve Client Confidential & Proprietary BKFTS & FIS Amended & Restated Data Center Agreement - dated January 1,2017 Page 1 of 21 of the obligation to make timely payment of the remaining undisputed portions. Client shall pay a late fee equal to the lesser of one and one-half percent (1\/4%) per month or the maximum interest rate allowed by law for any amount remaining unpaid and not subject to a good faith dispute more than thirty (30) days after its due date. 4.3 (a) In the event it is determined that the amount paid by Client to BKFTS with respect to Services provided in any month was more than the amount due to BKFTS for such month’s Services under Schedule B, then the next invoice issued by BKFTS to Client shall reflect a credit equal to the amount of the difference between (x) the amount paid to BKFTS by Client with respect to such month’s Services and (y) the amount actually owed to BKFTS by Client for such month’s Services. The amount of any such credit shall be applied to amounts owed by Client to BKFTS under future invoices. (b) In the event that any invoice submitted by BKFTS to Client does not include all Fees with respect to Services provided in the month to which the invoice relates, BKFTS may include any Fees not previously billed to Client on a subsequent invoice. 4.4 Each party shall be responsible for its own taxes, duties or similar charges arising out of this Agreement. 5. Confidentiality. 5.1 All nonpublic technical or business information disclosed by one party to the other party, including without limitation, software, documentation, data and designs, information related to a party’s business plans and\/or customers shall be deemed “Confidential” and shall be deemed the property of the disclosing party and shall be returned upon request. \"Confidential Information” shall also include all “non-public personal information” as defined in Title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (15 U.S.C. Section 6801, et seq.) and the implementing regulations thereunder (collectively, the “GLB Act\"), as the same may be amended from time to time, or “cardholder data” in the Payment Card Industry (PCI) standards) (collectively, “NPI”). The Confidential Information shall be used solely for the purposes of administering and otherwise implementing the terms of this Agreement. BKFTS shall restrict disclosure of such Confidential Information solely to its employees and employees of affiliated companies with a need to know to provide the Services under this Agreement and shall use a reasonable degree of care (in no event less than the same degree of care it uses for its own proprietary information) to prevent the unauthorized disclosure, use or publication of such Confidential Information. 5.2 Except in the case of NPI or any other class of information the privacy and\/or security of which is regulated by applicable federal, state or local laws and regulations, the receiving party shall have no obligation to preserve the confidentiality of any information which: (1) was previously known to the receiving party or any of its affiliated companies free of any confidentiality obligation; (2) is disclosed to third parties by the disclosing party without restrictions; (3) becomes publicly available by other than unauthorized disclosure; or (4) is independently developed by the receiving party. 5.3 BKFTS warrants that it has implemented and throughout the term of this Agreement shall maintain security measures designed to: (i) protect the security and confidentiality of Client’s Confidential Information; (ii) protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such Confidential Information; and (iii) protect against unauthorized access to or use of such Confidential Information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer of Client. BKFTS shall maintain and enforce at the facilities out of which the Services are provided security procedures (including without limitation external security with respect to appropriate lighting, patrols and security staff, security at all exit and entry points of the facilities, incremental security to floors and rooms where equipment and\/or network connections are housed to restrict and monitor access) that are sufficient for BKFTS to satisfy its obligations under this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, BKFTS warrants that during the term of this Agreement, all BKFTS Personnel who provide media services or serve as critical facilities personnel, as those terms are mutually understood by the parties, under this Agreement will have been subject to a Background Check. The term “Background Check” shall mean : A) an ID Search to verify Social Security number and determine prior addresses and additional names or aliases; and B) a seven (7) year comprehensive 50 state criminal background search to include federal, state and county records. Such Background Check shall be performed by BKFTS’ background check vendor, at BKFTS’ cost. Under no circumstances shall BKFTS be required to provide to Client copies of any Background Check report on BKFTS Personnel. 5.4 Upon reasonable request, Client may review BKFTS's then-current applicable security procedures and policies and may provide copies of such security procedures and policies to customers of Client in connection with such customers’ review of Client's security procedures and policies. BKFTS shall notify Client within twenty-four hours of: (i) any material unauthorized possession or use of the data-processing files or other Confidential Information; (ii) the effect of such; and (iii) the corrective action taken in response thereto. BKFTS acknowledges that Client may be required to also notify its customers of such security incidents and agrees to cooperate with Client in making such notification to such customers. Client shall also have the right, upon reasonable prior written notice and during Confidential & Proprietary BKFTS & FIS Amended & Restated Data Center Agreement - dated January 1,2018 Page 2 of 21 normal business hours (and no more than once each year), to review BKFTS’ books and records and visit the BKFTS facilities that are utilized in providing the Services for the purpose of determining the adequacy of the procedures employed by BKFTS for compliance with its obligations relating to security and Confidential Information under this Agreement. All such reviews and visitations must be reasonable in scope and duration, and shall be conducted at the expense of Client. Upon Client's request, BKFTS shall also provide Client with a certified copy of its most recent SSAE-16 or similar report. Client is granted a maximum of ten (10) opportunities, or as mutually agreed to, per year for Client’s clients to visit the BKFTS facilities that are utilized in providing the Services. Client must provide a minimum of fourteen (14) days written notice to BKFTS before any such visit. Before any visit can commence, Client, Client’s client and BKFTS must have executed a tri-party non¬ disclosure agreement, a template of which is attached as Exhibit A to this Agreement; provided that Client’s subsidiary(ies) or affiliate(s) that is\/are party to the applicable agreement(s) for products and\/or services to Client’s client(s) may be the Client entity(ies) entering into and performing such non-disclosure agreement(s) in each instance. 5.5 BKFTS will cooperate with Client, its internal auditors and external auditors who are not competitors, forthe purpose of inspecting, examining, and assessing: (i) the provision and performance of the Services provided under this Agreement; or (ii) BKFTS’ information security program as it relates to the Services. Any such inspection, examination and\/or audit may take place only upon not less than thirty (30) days prior written notice to BKFTS, during normal business hours and in a manner that will not materially disturb the ordinary transaction of BKFTS’ business. Requests for inspections, examinations and audits will be scheduled by BKFTS on a first come, first served basis in relation to similar requests from other BKFTS clients. BKFTS will not be obligated to disclose any records, information or procedures relating to any other BKFTS client or that cannot be disclosed to Client or its auditors due to contractual restrictions imposed upon BKFTS by third parties. BKFTS may charge Client for any time in excess of forty (40) hours per year plus materials and out of pocket expense costs incurred by BKFTS as a cost of cooperating and assisting with the audit. Except for audits performed by government regulators (“Regulators”), Client will limit audits to a reasonable duration and no more than once (1) per calendar year (unless specifically required in writing by any applicable Regulators) and no audits may be scheduled to occur during November, December, or January. Client’s representatives may be required to sign BKFTS’ standard nondisclosure and confidentiality agreement in advance of performing any audits. Client will provide, and instruct its internal and external auditors to provide BKFTS with a copy of that portion of each written report containing comments concerning BKFTS or the Services provided under this Agreement. 5.6 Upon any termination or expiration of this Agreement, the receiving party will promptly return to the disclosing party or, at the disclosing party's option, destroy all tangible copies of the receiving party’s Confidential Information in its possession or control by the following methods: TYPE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION STORED OR USED DESTRUCTION METHOD\nHard Copy Shredding, pulverizing, burning, or other suitable destruction method so that any Proprietary Information is not readable at all and cannot be reassembled or reconstructed in any way so that it is practicably readable.\nElectronic Tangible Media, such as CDs, Disks, Tapes Destruction or erasure of such media so that any Confidential Information is not readable at all and cannot be reassembled or reconstructed in any way so that it is practicably readable.\nHard Drive Storage or similar Computer or Device Storage Erasure or elimination of Confidential Information from such device so that any Confidential Information is not readable at all and cannot be reassembled or reconstructed in any way so that it is practicably readable.\n6.

Confidential & Proprietary BKFTS & FIS Amended & Restated Data Center Agreement - dated January 1,2018 Page 7 of 21 SCHEDULE A This Schedule A is a Statement of Work (\"SOW”) and sets forth the Services to be provided by Black Knight Financial Technology Solutions, LLC (“BKFTS”) to Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively \"Client” or \"FIS”) pursuant to that certain Amended and Restated Data Center Services Agreement, dated as of January 1, 2018 (the “Agreement”). by and between BKFTS and FIS, and is hereby incorporated by reference therein and made a part thereof. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this Schedule A shall have the meanings attributed to them in the Agreement. 1. Background On July 2, 2008, in connection with the spin-off of Lender Processing Services, Inc. (\"IPS Parent”) from FIS, LPS Parent and FIS entered into a FIS Reverse Corporate and Transitional Services Agreement (the “TSA\"). Pursuant to the TSA, LPS Parent provided certain services to FIS following the spin-off, including but not limited to certain information technology transitional services (the “IT Transitional Services”). The TSA expired 24 months following the spin-off, or on July 1,2010. On July 1, 2010, LPS and FIS entered into a Data Center Services Agreement (the \"2010 Agreement\"), the terms and conditions of which, together with the schedules thereto, governed the ongoing provision of information technology services by LPS to FIS from the date thereof through December 31, 2010. On January 1, 2011, LPS and FIS entered into an Amended and Restated Data Center Services Agreement (the “2011 Agreement\"), which amended, restated, and superseded the 2010 Agreement in its entirety. On January 1, 2012, LPS and FIS entered into an Amended and Restated Data Center Services Agreement (the \"2012 Agreement”), which amended, restated, and superseded the 2011 Agreement in its entirety. On January 1,2013, LPS and FIS entered into an Amended and Restated Data Center Services Agreement (the “2013 Agreement”), which amended, restated, and superseded the 2012 Agreement in its entirety. On January 1,2014, BKFTS’s predecessor, BKIS, LLC, and FIS entered into an Amended and Restated Data Center Services Agreement (the \"2014 Agreement”), which amended, restated, and superseded the 2013 Agreement in its entirety. On January 1, 2015, BKFTS and FIS entered into an Amended and Restated Data Center Services Agreement (the \"2015 Agreement”), which amended, restated, and superseded the 2014 Agreement in its entirety. On January 1, 2016, BKFTS and FIS entered into the 2016 Agreement, which amended, restated, and superseded the 2015 Agreement in its entirety. On January 1, 2017 BKFTS and FIS entered into the Agreement, which amends, restates, and supersedes the 2016 Agreement in its entirety. On January 1, 2018 BKFTS and FIS entered into the Agreement, which amends, restates, and supersedes the 2017 Agreement in its entirety. This Schedule A describes all of the Services provided to FIS by BKFTS which BKFTS and FIS mutually agree shall continue under the Agreement. The Services include and\/or are related to the co-location of equipment consisting of 1) the FIS Disaster Recovery environment and 2) the FIS managed FNF environment, both located in the BKFTS Jacksonville Technology Center at 601 Riverside Avenue, Jacksonville FL 32204 (“JTC”). 2. Inventory Methodology In August 2017 FIS validated a detailed inventory of all FIS managed equipment located in the JTC. The inventory list was provided by FIS and correlated to raised floor diagrams and documentation maintained by BKFTS. This inventory may be updated from time to time, upon prior mutual agreement by BKFTS and FIS, as FIS managed equipment is added to or removed from the JTC. FIS manages certain co-located assets on behalf of its customer Fidelity National Financial (\"FNF”). The FIS Managed Asset Inventory divides these assets into \"FIS Owned\" which reflects the FIS Disaster Recovery environment, and \"FNF Owned\" which reflects the FIS managed FNF environment. For purposes of this Agreement, FIS Owned and FNF Owned assets are collectively referred to as “FIS Managed Assets”. All equipment listed herein will be considered assets that are the responsibility of FIS and subject to the terms of this Agreement, regardless of the business distinction recorded by FIS. The FIS Managed Asset Inventory confirmed equipment details including identification and physical location within the JTC. The inventory listing denotes ownership of other peripheral equipment installed on the raised floor and used to support the equipment. The listing also details the physical space and power consumption for each device as measured Confidential & Proprietary BKFTS & FIS Amended & Restated Data Center Agreement - dated January 1,2018 Page 8 of 21 during the period of the audit. All racks used for servers and network devices are BKFTS property. For purposes of clarity, the \"owner\" column in the FIS Managed Asset Inventory depicts whether FIS Owned or FNF Owned equipment occupies that rack; it does not indicate legal ownership of the racks. BKFTS and FIS agree to utilize the following measures for power and space consumption for each device: Power: Actual amp readings will be utilized when possible. However, if actual amp readings are not available, nameplate ratings will be used. For the FIS Owned assets, initial amp readings were taken when the systems were in \"idle use”. Additional actual amp readings may be periodically taken during FIS’ DR exercise(s) to determine “active use” utilization. Space: Server rack space will be based on an agreed upon standard of 15 sq ft per rack. Network rack space will be based on an agreed upon standard of 18 sq ft per rack. For all other devices, space utilization will be captured on a floor drawing, reflecting actual footprint with service, growth and grey space utilizations. 3. Scope of Services 3.1 Overview BKFTS will provide the following facilities management services in the BKFTS Jacksonville Technology Center: « Provide, manage, and maintain raised floor space for the FIS Managed Assets. • Provide, manage and maintain environmental controls such as redundant electrical power and air conditioning for the FIS Managed Assets, including redundant UPS power supply and onsite backup generators. • Provide physical security controls and procedures for the FIS Managed Assets and for FIS personnel. • Provide floor space planning for the FIS Managed Assets. 3.2 Data Center Requirements - Equipment Configuration FIS Managed Assets added to the JTC after July 1,2010 shall meet BKFTS specified requirements and standards for JTC equipment as described in this section. No FIS Managed Assets are to be added to the JTC without prior approval of BKFTS' Critical Facilities personnel. FIS may, from time to time, request to add new equipment to the FIS Managed Asset Inventory. FIS agrees to provide BKFTS with reasonable notice, consistent with BKFTS change management lead times, of such planned activities. Rack-mounted equipment will be secured in lockable cabinets that conform to existing industry standards for the equipment. Non-rack equipment including tape silos and other peripherals shall be lockable, and will not exceed the floor loading specifications of the existing raised floor surface. BKFTS will maintain the JTC space plans and will specify where all new equipment is to be placed within the raised floor areas of the JTC. On a quarterly basis, FIS will provide BKFTS with a resource plan that outlines forecasted equipment expansion or removal activities for the remaining duration of the Agreement. Except for the specific space provision mentioned above, the amount of ongoing raised floor space occupied by FIS Managed Assets will expand no more than 5 percent (5%) of the total resource baseline, with short-term \"bubble” expansion not to exceed 20 percent (20%) of the total resource baseline. FIS will use reasonable efforts to ensure that in-cabinet consolidation or virtualization will optimize the FIS Managed Assets such that the amount of space does not exceed aforementioned expansion limitations. If after such efforts it is determined that the expansion limitation will be exceeded, FIS and BKFTS will work in good faith to mutually agree on a method to accommodate the request for additional space. On a monthly basis, FIS and BKFTS will jointly review the previous month’s change management tickets to update the resource baseline to reflect FIS Managed Assets additions and\/or deletions for the preceding period. Confidential & Proprietary BKFTS & FIS Amended & Restated Data Center Agreement-dated January 1, 2018 Page 9 of 21 BKFTS has the right to shut down, without prior notification to or approval from FIS, any infrastructure that may pose a risk to the JTC or is otherwise deemed unsafe. BKFTS shall provide FIS with prompt notification of any such shut down, as well as prompt notification of its resolution. In no event shall the resolution of any such infrastructure risk be postponed or delayed in order to provide notification to or receive approval from FIS with respect to any aspect of the resolution procedures. 3.3 Data Center Requirements - Physical Security FIS personnel supporting the FIS Managed Assets shall meet specified requirements for JTC physical security as described in this section.

FIS shall provide BKFTS with a listing of FIS personnel authorized to request physical access to the FIS Managed Assets. FIS personnel will be granted temporary access to the JTC based on an approved BKFTS change ticket where FIS personnel, that require access, are specifically listed. FIS personnel will not have persistent Data Center access to the JTC. All FIS personnel will be escorted and will follow BKFTS' standard sign-in \/ sign-out protocols. In the event any FIS vendor, that is not already a BKFTS approved vendor, requires physical access to the FIS Managed Assets, such access will follow BKFTS procedures for Data Center access, and the FIS vendor shall be escorted by authorized BKFTS personnel. The purpose of each entry to the secured JTC raised floor areas, whether by authorized FIS personnel or by an FIS vendor, shall be documented via a request to BKFTS. Such requests shall be submitted to BKFTS no later than five (5) business days prior to the scheduled maintenance or installation activity. The request shall include the device name and physical location within the JTC (e.g. server rack number), the approximate time at which such maintenance or installation activity shall take place and the name(s) of any authorized FIS personnel and\/or FIS vendor (both company name and individual name are required) who shall require access to the JTC for the performance of such maintenance or installation activity. All changes are subject to BKFTS maintenance window considerations and Systems Assurance approval. If unscheduled access is required for incident management, FIS shall notify BKFTS via appropriate escalation, as soon as practical in advance of the site visit. BKFTS will periodically review actual FIS personnel and FIS vendor access to the secured areas together with the corresponding problem and\/or change ticket documentation. BKFTS will promptly notify FIS if any such periodic review reveals that the above-described procedures are not being followed, and BKFTS retains the right to revoke sign in access of any FIS personnel or FIS vendor in the event that such FIS personnel or FIS vendor fails to follow these procedures. Any FIS personnel who regularly request physical access to the FIS Managed Assets, via change ticket, shall have been subject to a Background Check. The term \"Background Check\" shall mean : A) an ID Search to verify Social Security number and determine prior addresses and additional names or aliases; and B) a seven (7) year comprehensive 50 state criminal background search to include federal, state and county records. Such Background Check shall be performed by FIS’ background check vendor, at FIS' cost. Under no circumstances shall FIS be required to provide to BKFTS copies of any Background Check report on FIS personnel. Any non-FIS personnel such as third party vendors requiring access to the JTC to perform work on FIS Managed Assets on behalf of FIS must be authorized by FIS in similar fashion. FIS shall ensure that non-authorized personnel granted such access adhere to established JTC security and operational guidelines. 3.4 Data Center Requirements - Hardware Planning and Support BKFTS will provide the following hardware planning and support services: Confidential & Proprietary BKFTS & FIS Amended & Restated Data Center Agreement - dated January 1, 2018 Page 10 of 21 • Provide FIS with documentation specifying the facility and security requirements for FIS Managed Assets to be installed in the JTC. • Maintain physical security controls for authorizing receipt or removal of FIS Managed Assets in the JTC. • Schedule appropriate change management windows for equipment installation\/de-installation by FIS. • Provide a point of contact for FIS or its authorized third party to gain access to the JTC to service FIS Managed Assets. • Perform power load tests and certify equipment readiness for FIS equipment that FIS intends to install into the JTC. 3.5 Network Services - General The “BKFTS Network\", for purposes of this document, is defined as all network equipment, required cabling, cable systems, equipment housing, infrastructure, and transport owned by BKFTS. Network management of the BKFTS Network is the sole responsibility of BKFTS. The “FIS Network\", for purposes of this document, is defined as all network equipment, required cabling, cable systems, equipment housings, infrastructure, and transport owned or managed by FIS (e.g. any network or network devices managed by FIS on behalf of FNF). Network management of the FIS Network is the sole responsibility of FIS. All FIS Managed Assets shall be on the FIS Network. As additions, or changes to, requirements for connections are defined by FIS where such connection will require changes to the BKFTS network, BKFTS will define FIS’ network and equipment-related needs, design an appropriate solution, and make a proposal with FIS to reflect the additional charges, if any, for such changes. Upon mutual agreement, BKFTS and FIS will implement such work. 3.6 Network Services - Internet Access FIS utilizes BKFTS-provided internet bandwidth for its production and disaster recovery systems.. BKFTS will allocate such internet bandwidth to FIS until alternative capabilities are deployed by FIS and BKFTS provided services can be terminated.

P\nConfidential & Proprietary BKFTS & FIS Amended & Restated Data Center Agreement - dated January 1, 2018 Page 15 of 21 SCHEDULEB 1. Introduction This Schedule B describes the methodology for calculating the fees (collectively, the \"Fees”) with respect to the Services being provided by Black Knight Financial Technology Solutions, LLC (\"BKFTS”) to Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively “Client” or “FIS”) pursuant to that certain Amended and Restated Data Center Services Agreement, dated as of January 1, 2018 (the “Agreement”), by and between BKFTS and FIS, and is hereby incorporated by reference therein and made a part thereof. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this Schedule B shall have the meanings attributed to them in the Agreement. 2. Definitions Actual Usage means for each Resource Category set forth in this Schedule, the actual monthly number of Resource Units that were used or allocated for the Services. Actual Usage will be measured on a calendar month basis. Resource Category is any grouping of resources for which distinct volumes are measured and Resource Units and Unit Rates or other charging mechanisms apply. Resource Unit or RU means each unit of volume stated within each Resource Category. Unit Rate is the applicable monthly charge rate per Resource Unit for the particular Resource Category as set forth in this Schedule. 3. Variable Fees Associated with Schedule A Forthose Fees which are based on volume or usage, for each Resource Category identified in this Schedule, the corresponding Resource Unit for such Resource Category is defined and terms related to the tracking and measurement of Resource Units are provided. All Resource Unit consumption shall be measured and Fees invoiced on a calendar month basis, one month in arrears. a) Co-Location for FIS Managed Assets. Resource usage in this Resource Category will be measured as the number of kw (kilowatts) required for the FIS Managed Assets located in the JTC. One (1) kw equals one (1) RU. Monthly Fees attributable to this Resource Category shall be calculated as the number of RUs times the applicable Unit Rate set forth in Table 1. b) Excess Raised Floor Space. The Co-Location for FIS Managed Assets fee includes square footage equal to ten (10) times the total number of kw’s. Raised floor utilization in excess of this allowance will be charged as follows: Resource usage in this Resource Category will be measured as the number of excess square feet required for the FIS Managed Assets located in the JTC. One (1) square foot equals one (1) RU. Monthly Fees attributable to this Resource Category shall be calculated as the number of RUs times the applicable Unit Rate set forth in Table 1. c) Internet Bandwidth. Resource usage in this Resource Category will be measured as the number of mbps (megabits per second) of Internet Bandwidth allocated to FIS. One (1) mbps equals one (1) RU. Monthly Fees attributable to this Resource Category shall be calculated as the number of RUs times the applicable Unit Rate set forth in Table 1. 4. Fixed Fees Associated with Schedule A For those Fees which are not based on volume or usage, the Fees shall be calculated as set forth in this Schedule and invoiced on a calendar month basis, one month in arrears. a) Tape Management. FIS shall pay Monthly Fees in the amount of $5,000 per month for tape management services as described in Schedule A. Confidential & Proprietary BKFTS & FIS Amended & Restated Data Center Agreement - dated January 1, 2018 Page 16 of 21 5. Pass-Through Expenses a) 3rd Party Critical Facilities Work. In the event BKFTS is invoiced for work performed by a third Party provider for critical facilities work performed on FIS’ behalf, the cost will be charged to FIS as a Pass¬ through Expense. All such work is subject to pre-approval by authorized BKFTS and FIS designees. 6. Other Fees a) Assistance in the Event of FIS Disaster Declaration. In the event FIS declares a disaster in its Little Rock Technology Center that requires activation of FIS’s Disaster Recovery Plan utilizing the JTC, BKFTS will charge FIS for requested incremental services on a time and materials basis, using commercially reasonable rates to be determined at the time of the event. b) Penalty Fees. As set forth in Section 4.1 of the Agreement, on or before December 31, 2018, FIS must provide to BKFTS written confirmation that FIS will no longer require the Services after June 30, 2019. In the event FIS fails to provide BKFTS with such notice by December 31, 2018, then beginning with the month ended January 31, 2019 and continuing through the end of the Term of the Agreement, FIS shall pay to BKFTS a monthly penalty fee (the \"Penalty Fee”) equal to the total fee otherwise payable to BKFTS pursuant to the Agreement and this Schedule B for that month. This Penalty Fee shall be in addition to the monthly fee otherwise payable hereunder, and shall not be credited against any amounts otherwise owed by FIS to BKFTS under the Agreement. Furthermore, in the event that FIS provides such written confirmation to BKFTS on or before December 31, 2018, but subsequently determines that it will require the Services after June 30, 2019, FIS shall notify BKFTS of its continued need for the Services, and shall pay to BKFTS the monthly Penalty Fee for the remaining term of the Agreement. In addition, at the time FIS notifies BKFTS of its continued need for the Services, FIS shall pay to BKFTS a lump sum equal to any Penalty Fee which would have been due prior to the date on which such written notification was given. Notwithstanding the foregoing, FIS shall not be required to pay any Penalty in the event that it provides the above-described written confirmation to BKFTS on or before December 31, 2018, but subsequently determines that it will require the Services after June 30, 2019 if, and only if, the Services required after June 30, 2019 are Minimal Services. “Minimal Services” shall be Services that do not exceed 15% of the Services required by FIS as of January 1, 2018, or 42 kilowatts per month. For purposes of clarification, nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed to extend the term of the Agreement beyond June 30, 2019 and, in the event that FIS determines that it will continue to require Minimal Services after June 30, 2019, it shall promptly notify BKFTS of its need for continued Minimal Services and the parties shall negotiate in good faith to enter into a new agreement pursuant to which BKFTS shall continue to provide to FIS such Minimal Services after June 30, 2019.

The Receiving Party agrees to reveal the Confidential Information only to Representatives who need to know, who are informed by the Receiving Party of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information and who agree to act in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. 1. As used herein, “Confidential Information” shall mean any and all information furnished or disclosed, in whatever form or medium, concerning a Transmitting Party, including, without limitation, such Transmitting Party’s intellectual property, clients, customer lists, business contacts, business plans, policies, procedures, techniques, know-how, standards, products, programs, services, source or object code, product or service specifications, manuals, agreements, economic and financial information, marketing plans, data, reports, analyses, compilations, statistics, summaries, studies, trade secrets, and any other materials or information, or any materials based thereon, whether written or oral, furnished directly or indirectly by a Transmitting Party or any of such Transmitting Party's directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, accountants, advisors and other representatives (collectively, the “Representatives”) For purposes hereof, any technical or business information, or other information of the types listed above, of a third person furnished or disclosed by a Transmitting Party shall be deemed “Confidential Information\" of the Transmitting Party and subject to the terms of this Agreement. ■ 3. Nothing herein shall be construed as granting any right or license under any copyrights, inventions, or patents, or any other intellectual property or proprietary right, now or hereafter owned or controlled by the Transmitting Party, or obligating the Transmitting Party to disclose any information. The Receiving Party may not reverse engineer any of the Transmitting Party’s Confidential Information. 4. The term \"Confidential Information\" does not include information which (i) was or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by the Receiving Party or the Receiving Party's Representatives, or (II) was or becomes available to the Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Transmitting Party or its Representatives, provided that such source is not bound by a confidentiality agreement with the Transmitting Party, or (iii) was within the Receiving Party's possession prior to its being furnished, provided that the source of such information was not bound by a confidentiality agreement in respect thereof, or (iv) was independently created, developed or generated by the Receiving Party or the Receiving Party’s Representatives without any use of the Transmitting Party's Confidential Information. 5. Within a reasonable time after the Transmitting Party’s written request, the Receiving Party shall promptly return all material containing or reflecting any information contained in the Confidential Information and will not retain any copies, extracts, or other reproductions in whole or in part of such written material. All documents, memoranda, notes, or other writings whatsoever, prepared and based on the information contained in the Confidential Information shall be returned or destroyed.

The Receiving Party acknowledges the competitive value and confidential nature of the Confidential Information and that disclosure thereof to any third party could be competitively harmful to the Transmitting Party. In the event that the Receiving Party or any party to whom it transmits the Confidential Information pursuant to this Agreement becomes legally compelled to disclose any of the Confidential Information, the Receiving Party shall provide the Transmitting Party with prompt notice to the extent legally permissible, so that the Transmitting Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy.

The Receiving Party acknowledges and agrees that, given the nature of the Confidential Information and the competitive damage that would result to the Transmitting Party if information contained therein is disclosed to any third party, monetary damages alone would not be sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party, and that, in addition to all other remedies, the Transmitting Party shall be entitled to specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief as a remedy for any such breach or threatened breach, and the Receiving Party further agrees to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy. 8.

Termination. The term of this Agreement will begin on the last or only date of the signatures of the Order or Services Order into which it is incorporated below, or if executed by the parties, the last or only date of the signatures on this Agreement (the “Effective Date”) and will continue until terminated as set forth in this Section.

Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement or an Order or Service Order other than for Customer’s material breach, Customer may request that Dell Boomi, for a period of up to twelve (12) months (the “Termination Assistance Period”) and at Customer's expense (charged on a pro rata basis in accordance with the fees set out in the Order), continues to provide the Boomi Services that were provided prior to expiry or termination; Boomi shall have the right to require payment in advance for such services and Customer must notify Boomi in writing prior to such termination or expiration if Customer would like this extension of service.

Any provision of this Agreement that requires or contemplates execution after termination of this Agreement or a termination or expiration of an Order or Service Order is enforceable against the other party and their respective successors and assignees notwithstanding such termination or expiration, including, without limitation, the Conduct, Payment, Proprietary Rights, Taxes, Termination, Warranty Disclaimer, Infringement Indemnity, Limitation of Liability, Confidential Information, and General Sections of this Agreement.

Boomi may suspend Customer’s use of the Boomi Services (a) if so required by law enforcement or legal process, (b) in the event of an imminent security risk to Boomi or its customers as reasonably determined by Boomi. Boomi will make commercially reasonable efforts under the circumstances to provide prior notice to Customer of any such suspension. 7. Export. Customer’s purchase of Boomi Services and access to related technology (the “Materials”) are for its own use, not for resale, export, re-export, or transfer.

Boomi warrants that, during the term of an Order, the applicable Boomi Services will (i) substantially conform to the applicable Documentation (the “Operational Warranty”); (ii) be available twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week except for scheduled maintenance and the installation of updates as set out in Exhibit 1, and factors beyond the reasonable control of Boomi (the “Availability Warranty”). Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy and Boomi’s sole obligation for any breach of the Operational Warranty or Availability Warranty will be for Boomi to provide a fix or reasonably accepted workaround for the Boomi Services and for Boomi to provide Service Level Credits as defined in Exhibit 1. (b) Non-degradation Warranty. Boomi warrants that the features and functions of Service Description and the SLA at the date of this Agreement will not be materially diminished or degraded during the term of the Agreement or any renewals. However, it will not be a breach of the foregoing warranty if Boomi (a) provides written notice to Customer of its intent to diminish or degrade at least six (6) months prior to the implementation of any such changes (“Notice Period”); (b) continues to provide the relevant Boomi Service during the Notice Period substantially as it was immediately prior to the Notice Period; and (c) at Customer’s option, accepts Customer’s termination of the applicable Agreement during or within ninety (90) days after the Notice Period and refunds any fees prepaid by Customer to Boomi that are allocable to the period between Boomi’s receipt of Customer’s termination notice and the end of the period for which the fees have been paid. Exhibits A and B represent the Services provided to all Dell Boomi customers as of the Effective Date, as stated at www.boomi.com\/legal\/service\/ and DocuSign Envelope ID: 3D48A71A-7054-4BB2-BAC5-C9377E283ECB http:\/\/www.boomi.com\/SLA\/ (the “Service Description” and “SLA”, respectively). Dell Boomi may change the Service Description and SLA in its sole discretion. (c) Malware Warranty. Boomi warrants that, during the term of an Order, the applicable Boomi Services will not contain any viruses, worms, Trojan Horses, or other malicious or destructive code (collectively, “Malware”) designed by Boomi to allow unauthorized intrusion upon or disruption of the Boomi Services or Customer’s environment (the “Malware Warranty”). Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy and Boomi’s sole obligation for any breach of the Malware Warranty will be for Boomi to remove the Malware from the Boomi Services, assist Customer, at Boomi’s expense, in removing any Malware from Customer’s environment, and restore any affected data from any then-existing Boomi back up of such data to the extent that Customer enabled such backups. (d) Right to Terminate for Consistent Availability Failure. If the Boomi Integration Platform’s Service Availability is less than ninety-five percent (95%) in any three (3) calendar months in any consecutive five (5) month period or for 3 consecutive months, in addition to the Service Level Credits stated in the SLA, Customer may, at its option and upon written notice to Dell Boomi within thirty (30) days of the end of the relevant period, terminate the applicable Order and receive a refund of any fees prepaid to Boomi for unused services. In accordance with the SLA, “Service Availability” does not apply to Local Atom Environment (which is an atom environment residing within a customer’s network, outside Boomi’s domain). (e) Freezing the SLA. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, in the event that Boomi amends the SLA, such amended version of the SLA will be the operative SLA with respect to this Service Description and the Service (i) from that point forward, or (ii) upon the next renewal date of the term, if Customer provides written notice of Customer’s objection to the change within 30 days of the amendment. Any new features added by Boomi that update, augment, or enhance the Service will also be subject to this Service Description (f) Warranty Disclaimer. THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES AND REMEDIES SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION ARE THE ONLY WARRANTIES AND REMEDIES RECOVERABLE. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ALL OTHER WARRANTIES OR REMEDIES ARE EXCLUDED, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ORAL OR WRITTEN, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING FROM USAGE OF TRADE OR COURSE OF DEALING OR PERFORMANCE.

CUSTOMER UNDERSTANDS AND AGREES THAT THE BOOMI SERVICES ARE NOT FAULT-TOLERANT AND ARE NOT DESIGNED OR INTENDED FOR USE IN ANY HIGH-RISK OR HAZARDOUS ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE OPERATION OF NUCLEAR FACILITIES, AIRCRAFT OPERATION OR AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL, LIFE SUPPORT, WEAPONS, OR ANY OTHER APPLICATION WHERE FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION CAN REASONABLY BE EXPECTED TO RESULT IN DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY, SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE OR SEVERE ENVIRONMENTAL HARM (A “HIGH RISK ENVIRONMENT”). ACCORDINGLY, (I) CUSTOMER SHOULD NOT USE THE BOOMI SERVICES IN A HIGH-RISK ENVIRONMENT, (II) ANY USE OF THE BOOMI SERVICES BY CUSTOMER IN A HIGH-RISK ENVIRONMENT IS AT CUSTOMER’S OWN RISK, (III) BOOMI, ITS AFFILIATES AND SUPPLIERS WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO CUSTOMER IN ANY WAY FOR USE OF THE BOOMI SERVICES IN A HIGH-RISK ENVIRONMENT, AND (IV) BOOMI MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR ASSURANCES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, REGARDING USE OF THE BOOMI SERVICES IN A HIGH-RISK ENVIRONMENT. 9. Infringement Indemnity. Boomi will defend Customer from and against any claim, suit, action, or proceeding brought against Customer by a third-party to the extent it is based on an allegation that the Boomi Services infringe any patent, copyright, trademark, or other proprietary right in the countr(ies) in which the Services are provided and\/or in countries that are signatories to the Berne Convention or misappropriates a trade secret in such countries (a “Claim”). Boomi will pay (i) the resulting costs and damages finally awarded against Customer by a court of competent jurisdiction to the extent that such are the result of the third-party Claim, or (ii) the amounts stated in a written settlement negotiated and approved by Boomi. Boomi’s obligations under this Infringement Indemnity Section are conditioned upon Customer (i) giving prompt written notice of the Claim to Boomi, (ii) permitting Boomi to retain sole control of the investigation, defense or settlement of the Claim, and (iii) using all reasonable efforts to mitigate any actual or anticipated claims and providing Boomi with cooperation and assistance as Boomi may reasonably request in connection with the Claim. Boomi will have no obligation hereunder to defend Customer against any Claim (a) resulting from use of the Boomi Services other than as authorized by this Agreement, (b) resulting from a modification of the Boomi Services other than by Boomi or its subcontractors, (c) to the extent the Claim arises from or is based on the use of the Boomi Services with other products, services, or data not supplied by Boomi if the infringement would not have occurred but for such use, (d) based on Customer’s use of a superseded or altered release of any code, document, service, product, or deliverable after Boomi has recommended discontinuation, if the infringement would have been avoided by use of a current or unaltered release made available to Customer, (e) if Customer is in material breach of this Agreement and such breach has not been remediated within 30 days’ notice of the breach, or (f) based on any Boomi modifications made pursuant to instructions, desig ns, specifications or any other information provided by or on behalf of Customer, if any, if the infringement would not have occurred but for such modifications. If, as a result of a Claim or an injunction, Customer must stop using any portion of the Boomi Services (“Infringing Services”), Boomi shall at its expense and option either (i) obtain for Customer the right to continue using the Infringing Services, (ii) replace the Infringing Services with a functionally equivalent non-infringing Boomi Services, (iii) modify the Infringing Services so that they are non-infringing, or (iv) terminate the availability of the Infringing Services and refund the unused pro-rated portion of any fees pre-paid by Customer allocable to such Infringing Services.

THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THESE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY ARE AGREED ALLOCATIONS OF RISK CONSTITUTING IN PART THE CONSIDERATION FOR BOOMI PROVIDING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO CUSTOMER, AND SUCH LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY AND EVEN IF A PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LIABILITIES OR FAILURES. In no event may either Party bring any claim against a contractor, licensor, or supplier to the other for a matter associated with performance of this contract, beyond the amounts and theories of liabilities permitted if such claim were asserted against the other hereunder.

Confidential Information. (a) Definition. “Confidential Information” means information or materials disclosed by one party (the “Disclosing Party”) to the other party (the “Receiving Party”) that are not generally available to the public and which, due to their character and nature, a reasonable person under like circumstances would treat as confidential, including, without limitation, financial, marketing, and pricing information, trade secrets, know-how, proprietary tools, knowledge and methodologies, the Boomi Services, the Software (in source code and\/or object code form), information or benchmark test results regarding the functionality and performance of the Software, any Software license keys provided to Customer, and the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Confidential Information will not include information or materials that (i) are generally known to the public, other than as a result of an unpermitted disclosure by the Receiving Party after the Effective Date (ii) were known to the Receiving Party without an obligation of confidentiality prior to receipt from the Disclosing Party; (iii) the Receiving Party lawfully received from a third-party without that third-party’s breach of agreement or obligation of trust; or (iv) are or were independently developed by the Receiving Party without access to or use of the Discl osing Party’s Confidential Information; or (v) is transmitted or processed by Customer using Boomi Services and not sent by Customer for specific review by or discussion with personnel of Boomi provided that in cases where Boomi personnel have specifically had access to and viewed Customer data, then that data will be considered confidential. (b) Obligations. The Receiving Party will (i) not disclose the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information to any third-party, except as permitted in subsection (c) below and (ii) protect the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information from unauthorized use or disclosure by exercising at least the same degree of care it uses to protect its own similar information, but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care. The Receiving Party will promptly notify the Disclosing Party of any known unauthorized use or disclosure of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information and will cooperate with the Disclosing Party in any litigation brought by the Disclosing Party against third parties to protect its proprietary rights. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section will apply to all disclosures of the parties’ Confidential Information as of the Effective Date, whether or not specifically arising from a party’s performance under this Agreement. (c) Permitted Disclosures. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Receiving Party may disclose the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information without the Disclosing Party’s prior written consent to any of its Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, consultants, contractors or representatives (collectively, the “Representatives”), but only to those Representatives that (i) have a “need to know” in order to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to provide professional advice in connection with this Agreement, (ii) are legally bound to the Receiving Party to protect information such as the Confidential Information under terms at least as restrictive as those provided herein, and (iii) have been informed by the Receiving Party of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information and the requirements regarding restrictions on disclosure and use as set forth in this Section. The Receiving Party will be liable to the Disclosing Party for the acts or omissions of any Representatives to which it discloses Confidential Information which, if done by the Receiving Party, would be a breach of this Agreement. DocuSign Envelope ID: 3D48A71A-7054-4BB2-BAC5-C9377E283ECB Additionally, it will not be a breach of this Section for the Receiving Party to disclose the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information as may be required by operation of law, by tax or government authorities, or by legal process, provided that the Receiving Party provides prior notice of such disclosure to the Disclosing Party unless expressly prohibited from doing so by a court, arbitration panel or other legal authority of competent jurisdiction. 12. Personal Data. The provisions of Exhibit 4 will apply. 13. Conduct. Customer may not reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or attempt to discover or modify in any way the underlying source code of the Software, or any part thereof unless and to the extent such restrictions are prohibited by applicable law. Customer may not (i) modify, translate, localize, adapt, rent, lease, loan, create or prepare derivative works of, or create a patent based on the Boomi Services, or any part thereof, (ii) resell, provide, make available to, or permit use of or access to the Boomi Service or associated access credentials, in whole or in part, by any third party, (iii) use the Boomi Services to create or enhance a competitive offering or for any purpose which is competitive to Boomi, (iv) perform or fail to perform any other act which would result in a misappropriation or infringement of Boomi’s intellectual property rights in the Boomi Services. Each permitted copy of the Software made by Customer hereunder must contain all titles, trademarks, copyrights and restricted rights notices as in the original. In connection with the use of Boomi Services, Customer may not (v) attempt to use or gain unauthorized access to Boomi’s or to any third-party's networks or equipment; (vi) attempt to probe, scan or test the vulnerability of the Boomi Services, or a system, account or network of Boomi or any Boomi customers or suppliers; (vii) engage in fraudulent, offensive or illegal activity or intentionally engage in any activity that infringes the intellectual property rights or privacy rights of any individual or third party or transmit through the Boomi Service any data or information without the legal right to do so; (viii) transmit unsolicited bulk or commercial messages or intentionally distribute worms, Trojan horses, viruses, corrupted files or any similar items; (ix) restrict, inhibit, interfere or attempt to interfere with the ability of any other person, regardless of purpose or intent, to use or enjoy the Boomi Services or a user’s network, or cause a performance degradation to any facilities used to provide the Boomi Services. For any Customer who purchases any managed services, Customer will not cause Boomi to use anything from any third-party for which Boomi would need to obtain a license from such third-party in order to provide those managed services. Customer will cooperate with Boomi’s reasonable investigation of Boomi Services outages, security issues, and any suspected breach of this Section, and shall, at its expense, defend Boomi and its Affiliates from any claim, suit, or action by a third party (a “Third Party Claim”) alleging harm caused by Customer’s breach of this Section. Customer shall pay any judgments or settlements reached in connection with the Third Party Claim and Boomi’s costs of responding to it 14. Additional Matters. If Customer uses a Boomi Service in connection with creation and hosting of external-facing websites, Customer will comply with applicable law in any use of cookies or other tracking technologies on such websites. If Boomi is required to take any action because of Customer or its Third-Party Users violating applicable law or third-party rights, Customer will fully cooperate with any legal duties or related instructions of Boomi, and will promptly remove any illegal or offensive content from Customer systems. Boomi may also disable the applicable content, or the Boomi Flow service (howsoever named) or any application interacting therewith, until the potential violation is resolved. Boomi may make available (for example, through a Marketplace or otherwise) third-party products or services, including, for example, Non-Boomi Flow Applications and implementation and other consulting services. A \"Non-Boomi Flow Application\" means a web-based or offline software application that is provided by Customer or a third-party and interoperates with the Boomi Flow service sold hereunder, including, for example, an application that is developed by or for Customer or is listed on a Marketplace, i.e., an online directory, catalog or marketplace of applications that interoperate with the Boomi Flow Services. Any acquisition by Customer of non-Boomi Flow products or services, and any exchange of data between Customer and any non-Boomi Flow provider, is solely between Customer and the applicable non-Boomi Flow provider. Boomi does not warrant or support Non-Boomi Flow Applications or other non-Boomi Flow products or services. If Customer installs or enables a Non-Boomi Flow Application for use with a Boomi Flow Service, Customer grants Boomi permission to allow the provider of that Non-Boomi Flow Application to access Customer data as required for the interoperation of that Non-Boomi Flow Application with the Boomi Flow Service. Boomi Flow Services may contain features designed to interoperate with Non-Boomi Flow Applications. Boomi is not responsible for any disclosure, modification or deletion of any data resulting from access by a Non-Boomi Flow Application unless caused by Boomi. To use such features, Customer may be required to obtain access to Non-Boomi Flow Applications from their providers, and may be required to grant Boomi access to Customer account(s) on the Non-Boomi Flow Applications. If the provider of a Non-Boomi Flow Application ceases to make the Non-Boomi Flow Application available for interoperation with the corresponding Boomi Flow Service features on terms reasonably acceptable to Boomi, Boomi may cease providing those features without entitling Customer to any refund, credit, or other compensation. 15.

This information security overview applies to Dell’s corporate controls for safeguarding data which is processed and transferred amongst Dell group companies. Dell’s information security program enables the workforce to understand their responsibilities. Some customer solutions may have alternate safeguards outlined in the statement of work as agreed with each customer. Security Practices Dell has implemented corporate information security practices and standards that are designed to safeguard the Dell’s corporate environment and to address: (1) information security; (2) system and asset management; (3) development; and (4) governance. These practices and standards are approved by the Dell CIO and undergo a formal review on an annual basis. Organizational Security It is the responsibility of the individuals across the organization to comply with these practices and standards. To facilitate the corporate adherence to these practices and standards, the function of information security provides: 1. Strategy and compliance with policies\/standards and regulations, awareness and education, risk assessments and management, contract security requirements management, application and infrastructure consulting, assurance testing and drives the security direction of the company. 2. Security testing, design and implementation of security solutions to enable security controls adoption across the environment. 3. Security operations of implemented security solutions, the environment and assets, and manage incident response. 4. Forensic investigations with security operations, legal, data protection and human resources for investigations including eDiscovery and eForensics. Asset Classification and Control Dell’s practice is to track and manage physical and logical assets. Examples of the assets that Dell IT might track include: e Information Assets, such as identified databases, disaster recovery plans, business continuity plans, data classification, archived information. e Software Assets, such as identified applications and system software. e Physical Assets, such as identified servers, desktops\/laptops, backup\/archival tapes, printers and communications equipment. The assets are classified based on business criticality to determine confidentiality requirements. Industry guidance for handling data provides the framework for technical, organizational and physical safeguards. These may include controls such as access management, encryption, logging and monitoring, and data destruction. Personnel Security As part of the employment process, employees undergo a screening process applicable per regional law. Dell’s annual compliance training includes a requirement for employees to complete an online course and pass an assessment covering information security and data privacy. The security awareness program may also provide materials specific to certain job functions. Physical and Environmental Security Dell uses a number of technological and operational approaches in its physical security program in regards to risk mitigation. The security team works closely with each site to determine appropriate measures are in place and continually monitor any changes to the physical infrastructure, business, and known threats. It also monitors best practice measures used by others in the industry and carefully selects approaches that meet both uniqueness’s in business practice and expectations of Dell as a whole. Dell balances its approach towards security by considering elements of control that include architecture, operations, and systems. Communications and Operations Management The IT organization manages changes to the corporate infrastructure, systems and applications through a centralized change management program, which may include, testing, business impact analysis and management approval, where appropriate. Incident response procedures exist for security and data protection incidents, which may include incident analysis, containment, response, remediation, reporting and the return to normal operations. To protect against malicious use of assets and malicious software, additional controls may be implemented, based on risk. Suc h controls may include, but are not limited to, information security practices and standards; restricted access; designated development and test environments; virus detection on servers, desktops and notebooks; virus email attachment scanning; system compliance scans; intrusion prevention monitoring and response; logging and alerting on key events; information handling procedures based on data type, e-commerce application and network security; and system and application vulnerability scanning. Access Controls Access to corporate systems is restricted, based on procedures to ensure appropriate approvals. To reduce the risk of misuse, intentional or otherwise, access is provided based on segregation of duties and least privileges. Remote access and wireless computing capabilities are restricted and require that both user and system safeguards are in place. DocuSign Envelope ID: 3D48A71A-7054-4BB2-BAC5-C9377E283ECB Specific event logs from key devices and systems are centrally collected and reported on an exceptions basis to enable incident response and forensic investigations. System Development and Maintenance Publicly released third party vulnerabilities are reviewed for applicability in the Dell environment. Based on risk to Dell’s business and customers, there are pre-determined timeframes for remediation. In addition, vulnerability scanning and assessments are performed on new and key applications and the infrastructure based on risk. Code reviews and scanners are used in the development environment prior to production to proactively detect coding vulnerabilities based on risk. These processes enable proactive identification of vulnerabilities as well as compliance. Compliance The information security, legal, privacy and compliance departments work to identify regional laws and regulations applicable to Dell corporate. These requirements cover areas such as intellectual property of the company and our customers, software licenses, protection of employee and customer personal information, data protection and data handling procedures, trans-border data transmission, financial and operational procedures, regulatory export controls around technology, and forensic requirements. Mechanisms such as the information security program, the executive privacy council, internal and external audits\/assessments, internal and external legal counsel consultation, internal controls assessment, internal penetration testing and vulnerability ass essments, contract management, security awareness, security consulting, policy exception reviews and risk management combine to drive compliance with these requirements. In addition to the above, the Supplier will implement and operate: (i) a vulnerability management programme that is undertaken on a frequent basis (at least quarterly) that includes: • scanning the networks, infrastructure, applications and websites used in the provision of the Services; • validating any vulnerabilities found, and determining their criticality based upon industry recognised methods such as CVSS; • creating and undertaking a plan to remediate the discovered vulnerabilities, based upon their criticality, at its own cost and in a timely manner; (ii) regular penetration tests upon the networks, infrastructure, applications and websites used in the provision of the Services, no less than once per calendar year. Supplier undertakes to resolve, or otherwise mitigate, all critical and high risk findings in no less than one calendar month; (iii) strong encryption technologies to protect logon credentials, and Worldpay Data during transmission and storage; (iv) standards to ensure that its systems are configured in a secure state, in line with industry recognised best practices, such as NIST or the Center of Internet Security; (v) training in accordance Good Industry Practice on secure software development at least annually for Personnel involved in the architecture and design, and development and testing of Worldpay software; (vi) where all, or part of, the Services are provided using online services (i.e. accessible via the internet), the Supplier must ensure that adequate protection is in place to mitigate the risk of denial-of-service (DoS) threats. DocuSign Envelope ID: 3D48A71A-7054-4BB2-BAC5-C9377E283ECB Annex 2 Data Processing Description 1. Subject matter and duration of the Processing The subject matter and duration of the Processing shall be according to the Agreement. 2. Purpose of Processing Personal Data will be processed for the purpose of providing warranty- and support- related and\/or deployment services, as relevant and defined by the selected service levels and support options. The Agreement and the relevant service descriptions and statements of work shall apply for the specifics and possible additional services. 3. Nature of Processing. IT support: Processor mainly processes IP-addresses, MAC-addresses or other technical IDs of IT-systems that are possibly assigned to a person. This generally happens, if necessary, by analyzing error-logs. Support services: Processor personnel may come into contact with Personal Data, contingent of Controller’s internal policies, on the occasion of providing the customer and technical support services. This may happen by providing remote support or when entering Controller’s premises to do hardware repair. In these occasions, the person incidentally may see documents, name tags, content on screens. The same may apply in cases of remote support screen sharing (e.g. via webex), if the Controller has not closed the relevant programs\/software before the connection is established. Trace dump files: For certain products and in certain support situations a trace dump file may be analysed to assess the problem. A trace dump contains the read\/write or transfer activity associated with an error. The content is generally written in OS error format and is agnostic to file types. Reconstruction of files and their potential content is not part of the analysis. It is highly unlikely that any personal information will be readable during the analysis. Data storage devices: Return or refurbishing of hardware storage devices (e.g. HDDs, SSDs, etc.), all data contained will be deleted or destroyed in automated processes. 4. Categories of Data Subjects The data subjects are Customer’s end users, employees, contractors, suppliers and other third parties relevant to the Services. 5. Types of Personal Data The type of personal data that may be submitted by the customer are: Contact details: which may include name, address, email address, telephone, fax, other contact details, emergency contact details, associated local time zone information.
