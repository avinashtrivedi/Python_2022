I. Term and Termination. Unless sooner terminated as provided herein, this Agreement shall be for an initial term of 24 months, commencing 12\/15\/2020 and ending 12\/14\/2022 (the “Initial Term”). After the Initial Term, this Agreement shall automatically renew for successive 12-month terms (together with the Initial Term, the “Term”). Either party may immediately terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the other party. II. Services. (i) Grubhub shall provide access to the System(s) to Client’s employees and\/or other designated individuals (each, an “Employee”), subject to the applicable System’s Terms of Use; and (ii) Grubhub shall provide Client with a bi-weekly electronic invoice (each, an \"Invoice\") with the total amount due for all orders placed by Employees through the System(s) during the applicable invoice period (each, a “Purchase” and collectively, the “Purchases”). Reports associated to the issued Invoices shall include for each Purchase: (A) the product subtotal; (B) the associated expenses (e.g., delivery fee, tax, tip); and (C) a 6% transaction fee. III. Client's Obligations. (i) Within 30 days after the date of Client’s first use of any System, Client shall use the System for its corporate orders first before other similar services for the locations listed in Section IX; (ii) For clarity, the restrictions in Section (III)(i) above do not prohibit Client from directly engaging with restaurants or caterers that are not available to Client through the System(s); and (iii) Client shall pay the total amount due on each Invoice within 45 days of such Invoice being posted on the Grubhub administrative website (each, a \"Payment Due Date\") via check, wire transfer or ACH.

Grubhub’s maximum total liability to Client arising out of or related to this Agreement, regardless of the cause of action, will not exceed the amount of transaction fees paid by Client in the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the date on which the claim arose. In no event shall Grubhub be liable to Client for any lost profits or revenue, loss of business, or business interruption or for any consequential, incidental, special, exemplary, indirect or punitive damages, regardless of the cause of action and whether or not Grubhub has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Grubhub is responsible for the acts or omissions of any of its independent contractor delivery drivers that it has directly engaged (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, delivery personnel engaged by any restaurant). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Client acknowledges and agrees that Grubhub is not responsible and therefore will have no liability for (i) the quality of the food or (ii) for delivery of the food provided by any individual or entity not directly engaged or contracted by Grubhub. Insurance Grubhub and its agents shall maintain the minimum amounts described in the attached Annex II VI. Intellectual Property; No Reverse Engineering.

Any dispute arising out of this Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rules, and both parties consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in New York County, New York. Each of the parties irrevocably waives any and all right to a trial by jury in any action or proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. VIII. Confidentiality. During the Term, Grubhub and Client may share with each other certain proprietary and\/or non-public information (collectively, “Confidential Information”). For purposes of this section, “Disclosing Party” means the party disclosing its Confidential Information and “Recipient” means the party receiving the Confidential Information from Disclosing Party. Recipient shall keep all Confidential Information strictly confidential. Disclosing Party retains all right, title and interest to its Confidential Information, and recipient acquires no rights therein by virtue of this Agreement except the limited right to use the Confidential Information solely as required to perform the services or fulfill its obligations under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Doc ID: C5b3a47ff089679653eacd6ffda0a8e920a00c53 US-2018 (GFW-SL) all data derived from Client’s and its Employees’ use of the System (e.g., order behavior, trend data, etc.) shall be owned exclusively by Grubhub. IX. Locations. Client will use the System(s) for its Riverside Ave Office in Jacksonville, FL office(s) and may expand such use to its other designated offices or locations (collectively as updated from time to time by the parties, the “Locations”); provided that, upon Client’s written notice to Grubhub that Client wishes to use the System(s) for any new Locations, the terms and conditions of this Agreement will automatically apply to such additional Locations without requiring any further written agreement. X. Entire Agreement; Miscellaneous. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between the parties, and supersedes any prior agreement or understanding with respect the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented unless mutually agreed upon in writing and signed by an authorized signatory of each party. Neither failure nor delay by either party in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such right, power or privilege. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable by a body of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect and, if legally permitted, such provision will be replaced with an enforceable provision, so as to come as close as possible to achieving the economic, legal or other purpose of such unenforceable provision. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

Indeed, we appreciate the opportunity to work with you on this project. We have constructed our proposal to address your need to overcome the hurdles you described with merchant onboarding and your POS provider relationships. I am confident that our experience in coalition loyalty planning and development, merchant recruitment and management will be of value to FIS; In addition, the expertise we have on our team in merchant acquiring and working with POS providers will serve you well to resolve the challenges you described. We are therefore pleased to provide you with this Proposal and Statement of Work. We have attempted to outline the optimal path for success over the proposed project period. Upon review, you may wish to make additional changes to fine tune this work approach. We are ready to have this conversation with you today to make sure we are in sync and that you can reach your objectives within your prescribed timeline. Given our agreement to meet at your offices on April 15th I propose we schedule a call for today or Monday April 11th latest to discuss your questions and move forward to an agreement. Thanks again for this opportunity to work with you and your team. Sincerely, Bill Hanifin Chief Executive Officer Cc: Dave Thompson, Hanifin Loyalty Proposal and Statement of Work Project Objectives As the world's largest provider of core processing, card issuer and transaction processing services to financial institutions and businesses worldwide, FIS is uniquely positioned to launch and successfully manage a customer loyalty program in support of its acquired merchant customer base in the United States. FIS has initiated a plan to bring a coalition of this nature to market and has identified two key challenges to this strategy. These challenges define the requirements of work requested by FIS and the work scope we outline in this proposal. 1. Access to a wide range of merchants is generally available to FIS through its current acquiring business. A scalable plan to recruit, onboard, and manage merchants for success over the long term is critical to successful operation of the coalition. a. Development of an actionable prospect pipeline filtered by several key factors is an important next step to develop a powerful merchant prospect funnel. b. The process of onboarding merchants needs to be refined and made actionable for ease of execution by FIS sales teams in market. c. An ongoing measurement plan and rationale for merchant management will ensure successful retention of participating merchants. d. Addressing these issues will yield benefit in gaining the cooperation of POS partners. 2. The ability to deliver loyalty value propositions and communications via Merchant Point of Sale (POS) equipment is critical to the success of this strategy. a. Achieving cooperation from POS providers to complete the integration between FIS and the merchant points-of-purchase is crucial if FIS is to expand the merchant prospect funnel and accelerate onboarding of qualified merchants. b. FIS can solve the POS integration issues through strategic partnerships with the providers, but needs to develop a powerful merchant prospect funnel to support negotiations for further cooperation. c. There may be alternate strategies to unlock this connection to the point-of- purchase, and FIS needs to exhaust these options to moves towards a program launch. Work Scope & Deliverables Our work and deliverables will be organized in two phases to address the challenges described above; Phase 1 • Strategy Development for Merchant Recruitment & Management \/ POS Partnerships Phase 2 • Execution of Merchant Recruitment and POS Partnership plans 2 Phase 1 Strategy Development for Merchant Recruitment & Management \/ POS Partnerships This work will be completed over 5-6 weeks between April 15 and May 31,2016, Working with your team, Hanifin Loyalty will focus on three key areas of foundational planning and deliver recommendations for actionable paths forward to address key challenges: • Solidify the business and strategic goals for the coalition project to support long term strategies and execution plans. • Define the Merchant Recruitment and Management plan. • Identify and prioritize key POS integration partners, then create the approach to develop successful partnerships with these POS providers. Key tasks in this Phase include: 1. Socialize global Coalition program best practices with FIS stakeholders. This can be accomplished through a workshop with key stakeholders. 2. Deliver a competitive assessment of Coalition programs in the North American market. 3. Clarify and reach consensus on FIS objectives in coalition loyalty and quantify the economic scope of the market opportunity. 4. Review of FIS proposed consumer value propositions (CVP), customer journey, and experience at participating merchants. 5. Identify \/ segment the current range and configuration of prospective merchants. 6. Score and prioritize merchants by vertical industry and other factors using our proprietary scoring systems for Coalition Loyalty development and planning. 7. Make Merchant recommendations to align with business objectives, filtered by the POS partnership strategic path. 8. Review FIS planned Merchant onboarding process and create recommendations for improvement. 9. Consolidate understanding of FIS technology capabilities to deliver consumer loyalty offers at POS, facilitate other loyalty functionality at POS, and enable \"real time\" redemption. 10. Identify key challenges to overcome POS integration objectives and identify tactics to close gaps. 11. Explore and rationalize the strategic benefits for FIS through alternate approaches to deliver program benefits to consumers via its merchants 12. Identify optimal POS partners aligned with FIS Coalition objectives. 3 Phase 2 - Merchant Recruitment Phase 2 wili be delivered on an ongoing basis with the initial term for this agreement being 12 months beginning June 1, 2016. Once the POS integration solution and merchant development strategy is completed and agreed in Phase 1, we will move to an executionai phase of work to recruit and onboard merchants to expand the coalition program. This recruitment will require a continual and consistent effort over a minimum 12 month period. The road map will be based on partnership recruitment, merchant on-boarding and sales management disciplines for success. The key deliverables are described as follows: • Using the prioritized list of key prospects created in Phase 1, create timeline for recruitment of both regional and national merchants. • Analyze territories and vertical clusters where FIS is concentrated to optimize acquisition success. • Understand potential competitive barriers; proprietary merchant or POS provider loyalty programs. • Work to support FIS field teams to support execution of Merchant Recruitment plan via In-person sales meetings and conference calls. • Establish key measurement dashboard with Monthly\/Quarterly sales targets. • Develop merchant recruitment toolkit including Letters of Intent (LOI), Contracts and onboarding work flows. • Execute strategic plan to create partnerships with POS providers. • Recommend options for alliances and leverage relationships where there are mutual benefits to both FIS and acquired merchants. • Create a reusable strategic partnership presentation. • Pursue the possibility of alternate platforms beyond current FIS and POS provider capability to deliver real time redemptions and other loyalty capabilities. Form of Deliverables Project deliverables will be based on recommendations and executionai plans related to each subject area of work shown above. The form of our Phase 1 deliverable will be a combination of an in-person presentation of findings to your team with a written document created in a combination formats established by mutual agreement. Phase 2 deliverables will be measured by ongoing sales and onboarding repotting, monitored on a bi-weekly or monthly frequency as agreed. 4 FIS Resource Requirement Hanifin Loyalty will be responsible for project deliverables and responsibilities. The work will be delivered working closely with the FIS teams and enabled via understanding more about your systems and POS operational areas. Project timing is always subject to the turn-around time of information requested and availability of your key stakeholders, therefore, we understand your competing business priorities may add time to this estimate.

Capitalized terms used in this Amendment, the definitions for which are not found in this Amendment, are defined in the ESSO or the applicable Associated Document(s). In the event of a conflict between the terms of the Agreement and this Amendment, this Amendment shall prevail. Upon execution of this Amendment, FIS, as the succeeding contracting member of the Enterprise to Worldpay Inc., and IBM agree that the Enterprise Software and Services Option (“ESSO”) between Vantiv LLC and International Business Machines Corporation signed June 25, 2011 and all amendments thereto, (collectively, the \"Worldpay ESSO\") will be terminated. The Vantiv\/Worldpay Open Infrastructure Offering dated June 24, 2011 as amended (“Vantiv OIO”) is hereby further amended to eliminate any obligation to make any new purchase or enter into any new lease pursuant to the Vantiv OIO and to eliminate: (i) the IBM Purchase Commitment (as defined in the Vantiv OIO) and any obligation to pay any amount for failing to meet the IBM Purchase Commitment, (ii) any Settlement Charges (as defined in the Vantiv OIO) and any obligation to pay any Settlement Charges pursuant to the Vantiv OIO, and (iii) and credits or discounts related to the IBM Purchase Commitment, effective December 31,2019. No credits or discounts previously provided pursuant to the Vantiv OIO are repayable. FIS represents and warrants the authority to make such amendment on behalf of Vantiv\/Worldpay. This Amendment includes the following Attachments, Exhibits and Schedules to be incorporated herein: Schedule A10 - New Distributed Software Content Schedule B10 - Restated Renewals from Amendment 9 Attachment A10 - VUE Pricing Table Supplement B10 - International Supplement 1. Contract Term Notwithstanding the End Date set forth in the Agreement this Amendment is effective as of December 31,2019 (“Start Date”) and remains in effect up to and including December 31,2023 (“End Date”), unless earlier terminated as provided in the Agreement. 2. Definitions The following definitions replace those in the Agreement: CBA Offerings means prospective purchases made using CBA, directly from IBM, of IBM Programs and Appliances, IBM Products, IBM software, IBM hardware, MLC Programs, and IBM Program-related Services performed directly by IBM Software Lab Services. CBA Offerings do not include MLC to one  time charge Value Unit Editions (“VUEs”), Red Hat products and services, or outsourcing services. Actual Inventory Value mean the cumulative sum of the recurring license charges of the installed MLC Programs for the period reflected in the MLC Maximum Table below. IBM will calculate the Actual Inventory Value based on the most beneficial license pricing metric in Client’s ICA and its Attachments for which Client qualified at the time of usage. Actual Inventory Value for Worldpay's, single tenant environment, is based on CMP\/CMLC pricing. FIS Actual Inventory Value is based on AWLC, PSLC\/ULC, AEWLC metrics. Actual Inventory Value does not include any charges for use of MLC Programs on Specialty Engine Capacity used to execute exclusively Authorized Workload, but Actual Inventory Value does include charges for any Specialty Engine Capacity used to execute any workload other than Authorized Workload (such charges to be calculated at the rates applicable to General Purpose Capacity). If it is determined that at any time Client did not qualify for a license pricing metric that was used to calculate the Actual Inventory Value, it will be recalculated using the pricing metric for which Client did qualify for such time period, and Client will be responsible for full payment of any additional amounts. If it is determined that at any time Client were executing on Specialty Engine Amendment 10 Page 1 of 62 IBM Confidential Amendment No. 10 to Enterprise Software and Services Option Capacity any workload other than Authorized Workload, the Actual Inventory Value will be recalculated using the charges for the MLC Programs installed on such Specialty Engine Capacity which are applicable to General Purpose Engine Capacity and Client will be responsible for full payment of any additional amounts. In addition, if Client uses any Unauthorized Built-in-Capacity Client agrees to pay for such Capacity, at the charges for such Capacity as if it was acquired from IBM at the prices for which Client then qualifies. The following definitions are added: IBM For purposes of the International Supplement, \"IBM\" shall mean the Lead IBM Entity as defined below. For purposes of each Local Transaction Document (which incorporates the International Supplement, “IBM” shall mean that Local IBM Entity executing the Local Transaction Document. Lead IBM Entity International Business Machines Corporation Lead Client Entity Fidelity Information Services, LLC Local Transaction Document (\"LTD\") A document which contains country-specific terms and which incorporates by reference the terms and conditions of the International Supplement, that is executed by the Local IBM Entity and the Local Client Entity in each country in which a Local IBM Entity provides ESSO Offerings to a Local Client Entity. Client For purposes of the International Supplement, “Client” shall mean the Lead Client Entity. For purposes of each Local Transaction Document (which incorporates the terms of the International Supplement), “Client” shall mean that Local Client Entity executing the Local Transaction Document. 3. Continuation of Amendment 9 Terms and Conditions. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Amendment 10, all terms and conditions contained in the Agreement including Amendment 9 shall continue unmodified through the term of this Amendment. 4. Service Provider Terms. The terms and conditions of Amendment 5 shall survive during the term of the Agreement. 5. ESSO Offerings The section “Esso Offerings” is deleted and replaced with the following: The offerings that qualify for the terms of this Agreement (”ESSO Offerings”) may only be acquired directly from IBM and are as follows: a. CBA and CBA Offerings b. Products included in Schedule A10 - Products List, which is attached to and made part of this Agreement (the “Listed Software Products”) are comprised of the following: i. Products and Programs ii. IBM Subscription and Support (“S&S”) renewals for previously acquired Programs Included in the Option Charges are charges for any applicable S&S and such S&S has a coverage period up to and including December 31,2023 unless otherwise specified in the Schedule A10 - Products List. If S&S is withdrawn on or before the End Date for a Listed Software Product, then prior to the date of such withdrawal, IBM, in its sole discretion, will either continue to provide S&S to you for that Listed Software Product until the end of the then current coverage period or give you a prorated credit, as reasonably determined by IBM, for such withdrawn S&S at the beginning of each coverage date period for the Listed Software Product subject to such withdrawal. Any such credit will be valid for a period of twelve (12) months from the date of issue and may be used to purchase IBM Programs or Program- Amendment 10 Page 2 of 62 IBM Confidential Amendment No. 10 to Enterprise Software and Services Option related services at mutually agreed pricing provided that it is within IBM's then current established standalone selling price. Any unused credit will be forfeited. For avoidance of doubt, all licenses to VUE Programs are non-expiring licenses and Your Enterprise may use VUE Programs subject to the terms of this ESSO and the Associated Documents. The following provisions of this Section 5 shall apply through December 31,2021: You shall continue to receive support services for the Special Programs that are substantially similar to the IBM Software Subscription and Support services that were provided by IBM during the 12 months prior to any such divestiture In addition, as part of the IBM Software Subscription and Support services, IBM will make available to you any updates that HCL makes generally available for the Special Programs after the closing of the IBM-hCl Divestiture Agreement. 6.

Included in the Option Charges are the following available CBA amounts listed in the CBA Availability Table, which in the aggregate total: $ 72,752,693.20: The CBA Availability Table is replaced as of January 1, 2020 with the table on Supplement B - International Supplement to this Amendment. The following paragraphs are deleted and replaced to reflect the End Date change: Items acquired using the CBA must be ordered via a written communication (“CBA Written Order”) prior to the earlier of December 31, 2023 or the date of termination of this Agreement. The CBA Written Order must include the description of the products or services Client is acquiring; references to the price quote provided to Client by IBM; and indicate that Client intends to use the CBA to pay for or otherwise finance such products or services. IBM services will be provided pursuant to a Statement of Work agreed to by the parties and issued under the ICA or any equivalent agreement in effect between the parties. Any services acquired under the CBA must be delivered after the Start Date and completed prior to the earlier of December 31, 2023 or the termination of this Agreement. The following section is added: CBA Credits Any credit made available to Client under this subsection of the Agreement may only be used for obligations accruing after the date the credit is offered and in accordance with the Provision for Cross Brand Allotment section and the Associated Documents. CBA Credit for S&S Not Renewed: Local Client Entity may choose not to renew S&S coverage in accordance with the Associated Documents on each S&S Anniversary for quantities of Listed Software Products specified by Local Client Entity that are marked as ‘Renewals of Existing’ on Schedule A (“S&S Products”) in exchange for: A. A credit to be applied to Local Client Entities CBA (“CBA S&S Credit”), which shall not exceed the values in the table below: Amendment 10 Page 3 of 62 IBM Confidential Amendment No. 10 to Enterprise Software and Services Option Maximum CBA S&S Credit $US FIS Maximum CBA S&S Credit £GBP Worldpay UK $1,427,715.35 £364,407.20 The value of each separate CBA S&S Credit for any S&S Amendment is calculated by multiplying: 1) the S&S Reference Price set forth in Schedule A10 Table 3, 4 and 5 and Schedule B10 for the Us and Table 6 for the UK for each Program by 2) the quantities of Programs for which Local Client Entity requests not to renew S&S coverage. The CBA S&S Credits will be tallied to provide the aggregate S&S credit for the S&S Amendment. Credits are subject to the following terms and conditions: I. Client may not select S&S Products that are installed and in service within Client’s Enterprise on the date that such notice is received by IBM; CBA S&S Credit values are maximum values within any 12 month S&S renewal period; II. At least 90 days prior to the S&S Anniversary date, Client must provide a written request to IBM: i. Listing the types and quantities of the S&S Product(s) on Schedule A Client elects not to renew; and III. If at a later date Client wishes to resume S&S for an affected Program, Client may do so in accordance with the applicable Associated Documents. S&S Amendment CBA S&S Credits Purchases will be provided under an amendment to this Agreement (he “S&S Amendment”). The S&S Amendment will include, where applicable: 1. the S&S End Date adjustments for all eligible S&S Products no longer renewed; 2. a restating of the CBA Availability table; and 3. a restating of the remaining CBA S&S Credit The Use of CBA for MLC Programs is amended as follows: The CBA Pricing Table is replaced with the following CBA PRICING TABLE  Description of Qualifying Elements Discount off price at the time of acquisition 1 MLC Programs 19% off Actual Inventory Value The MLC Maximum Table is replaced with the following: MLC Maximum Table Period Period Start Date Period End Date MLC Maximum 1 January 1,2020 December 31,2023 $ 88,460,115 The section “Expiration of the CBA” is deleted and replaced with the following: Amendment 10 Page 4 of 62 IBM Confidential Amendment No. 10 to Enterprise Software and Services Option Expiration of the CBA Any unused CBA shall accumulate until used prior to contract End Date. Any remaining CBA after the End Date will not be refunded or carried forward into any future period and will be automatically forfeited as of the End Date. You may use the CBA to acquire one subsequent 12-month S&S renewal for IBM Programs and IBM Appliances, at the prices specified in this Section, for the period following the End Date, provided only if (i) you maintain S&S in accordance with its applicable Associated Documents and S&S is ordered at least thirty (30) days prior to the End Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that FIS executes an amendment to this agreement prior to the End Date, any remaining CBA balance may be carried forward as part of the new amendment. 8. Aggregate Capped Programs - SPA 6 (a) Definitions. The following additional definitions apply to this Aggregate Capped Programs section: Calculation Date means the earlier of December 31,2023 or the termination of this Agreement. Aggregate Capped Program means any Listed Software Product identified on Schedule A10 as an Aggregate Capped Program (”ACP”). Aggregate Value means the sum of the quantities of ACPs that are deployed by you multiplied by the Unit Consumption Rate listed on Schedule A10 for that ACP. Enterprise means any legal entity that, by more than 50% owns, is owned by or is under common ownership with Fidelity Information Services, LLC or its parent company, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. Other Program Quantities means those quantities of IBM Programs which otherwise meet the definition of ACP but which were or are acquired outside the terms of this Agreement including those acquired from a third party that are part of a third party solution or application, and are not covered by the Option Charges and do not qualify for the purpose of calculating the Aggregate Value. (b) Deployment You may deploy ACPs within your Enterprise for production, test and development (i.e., no “stockpiling” of licenses) (“Active Use”) on machines you own or lease and operate within your Enterprise, provided that such ACP deployment may not, except as otherwise provided in Section 4 of Amendment 9, be used to provide a license for deployment that took place without a license entitlement prior to the Start Date; and (iii) the Aggregate Value of the ACP licenses deployed may not exceed $ 18,511,248. Any entities that become part of your Enterprise after the Start Date may not use ACP deployments to provide a license for deployment that took place without a license entitlement prior to the date on which they became part of your Enterprise. Once an ACP is deployed, it is included in the Aggregate Value determination even if it is later removed from use. However, any ACPs that are not in Active Use on the Calculation Date will not receive entitlements for continued use following the Calculation Date. You shall acquire IBM Subscription and Support Reinstatement on Other Program Quantities for which IBM Software Subscription and Support has expired prior to the deployment of such Other Program Quantities from the ACP, and you shall not terminate existing IBM Subscription and Support for Other Program Quantities and redeploy such Other Program Quantities from the ACP. If IBM has withdrawn from marketing or support any ACP Program then you may not further increase the quantity for the affected ACP without IBM’s prior written consent. For any ACP that requires a license key and which is identified as “Key Based” on Schedule A10, IBM will issue an initial quantity of license keys for such ACP. If deployment of ACP requires additional license keys, you must request these keys from IBM and IBM will provide them to you. Amendment 10 Page 5 of 62 IBM Confidential Amendment No. 10 to Enterprise Software and Services Option For an ACP with a PVU licensing metric, if virtualization technology is used to limit the processor capacity available for use with the Program to less than all the activated processor cores on the server(s), you agree to the terms under the section entitled “Programs in a Virtualized Environment” of the IPAA, or to any other agreement in place for such ACP which allows you to use the Program within a virtualized environment. (c) Reporting On the first day of each calendar quarter (e.g., January 1 st, April 1st, July 1st, October 1st) and the Calculation Date, you must provide IBM a written report, listing the cumulative quantities of licenses of each ACP deployed from the Start Date until the date of the report (“Total Deployment Quantity”) and the quantity of licenses currently in Active Use (“Currently in Active Use”) pursuant to this Agreement (the “Total Deployment Report”). Such report should not include any Other Program Quantities. Further, ACP licenses may not be reported in the Aggregate Value of this Agreement unless such ACP licenses are in excess of the Other Program Quantities. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any ACP identified as “Royalty” on Schedule A10 must be reported immediately upon deployment by you prior to any required reporting pursuant to this Agreement. (d) Entitlements Following the Calculation Date, you will be entitled to continue to use the number of licenses of each ACP reported to IBM in the column “Currently in Active Use” on the Total Deployment Report for ACP Eligible Programs. In the event of a conflict between this Agreement and any PoE issued prior to the Calculation Date, this Agreement shall govern.

S&S Price Protection for 2024 and 2025 Provided (i) your S&S has not lapsed; (ii) S&S is made generally available for the affected Program(s) (e.g., S&S has not been withdrawn), and (iii) you renew S&S for all quantities of all Programs on Schedule A10, you shall be entitled to receive prices not to exceed those listed below for acquisitions of S&S for all the quantities of Programs on Schedule A10. S&S must be ordered directly from IBM for the S&S Coverage Periods and at prices not to exceed those shown in the table below by providing written authorization to IBM (e.g., order form, order letter, purchase order) at least thirty (30) days prior to the beginning of the applicable S&S Coverage Period.

Your request will detail the amount of Prospective CBA to be transferred; the date on which such transfer will take place; the Source Client Entity and Source IBM Entity; and the Local Client Entity to which Prospective CBA will be transferred (the “Target Client Entity”), along with the corresponding Local IBM Entity (the “Target IBM Entity”). For avoidance of doubt, CBA can be transferred between Local Client Entity and the Lead Client Entity. (2) The Source IBM Entity will prepare or amend the Local Transaction Document to be executed by the Source and Target Client Entities; the Source and Target IBM Entities; reflecting the Option Charges and available CBA in the Source Client Entity that will be reduced by the amount of Prospective CBA transferred. The corresponding Option Charges and available CBA in the Target Client Entity will be increased by the amount of Prospective CBA transferred, converted (if required) to the currency of the Target Client Entity, using the interbank exchange rate published by www.oanda.com on the day prior to signature of the amendments. (3) IBM will provide updated versions of the CBA Availability Table and the Option Charges Table in an amendment to this Agreement.
