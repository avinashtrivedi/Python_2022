In connection with the execution of this Amendment, Lender is making a construction and permanent loan (“Loan”) to Borrower in the original principal amount of $10,000,000. B. In connection with the Loan, Lender and Borrower are entering into certain loan documents setting forth the terms and conditions of the Loan, including but not limited to, the Construction Loan Agreement, Promissory Note, Commercial Security Agreement, Construction Deed of Trust, Disburser’s Notice, Agreement to Provide Insurance, Notice of Insurance Requirements, Disbursement Request, Authorization and Errors and Omissions Agreement and Secretary’s Certificate (collectively, the “Loan Documents”). C. In connection with the Loan, Lender and Borrower now hereby desire to amend certain of the Loan Documents in certain respects. NOW, THEREFORE, Lender and Borrower agree as follows: 1. Capitalized Terms. Except as otherwise defined herein, all capitalized terms set forth in this Amendment shall have the respective meanings given to such terms in the Loan Documents. 2. General. Paragraphs 3 through [18] of this Amendment are intended to modify and supplement all of the Loan Documents, as applicable. Paragraphs [18] through [22] of this Amendment are intended to modify and supplement the particular Loan Document therein described. Lender acknowledges that Borrower currently has certain senior financing through Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as evidenced by the Second Amendment to Credit Agreement dated October 26, 2012 as may be amended or modified (the “Senior Financing”) (which Senior Financing will not be secured by the Property), and Borrower is subject to the obligations and terms set forth in the loan documents related to such Senior Financing (as may be modified). Borrower represents and warrants to Lender that the Loan does not contravene nor violate, and is not otherwise inconsistent with any term or provision of the Senior Financing, as may be modified. Borrower further represents and warrants to the Lender that the Senior Financing in no way diminishes or otherwise affects Lender’s rights and remedies with respect to the Property under the Loan Documents. Borrower agrees to provide Lender with written notice of any modification in the Senior Financing which is reasonably likely to result in a material adverse effect (as defined in Paragraph 6 below) or to materially impair Lender’s rights and remedies with respect to the Property under the Loan Documents. Borrower shall not agree to nor permit any modification in the Senior Financing which would constitute an event of default under the Loan Documents. 3. Lender’s Review and Consent. Any approval, consent, determination, requirement, review or other action by Lender pursuant to the Loan Documents shall be given or made by Lender in a commercially reasonable manner consistent with customary banking practices in the State of Colorado, and consistent with such standard Lender shall not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay any such approval, consent, determination or review. Any reference in the Loan Documents to Lender’s “sole discretion” (or other phrases of similar import) shall be deemed to refer instead to Lender’s “reasonable discretion”, which shall be exercised in a commercially reasonable manner consistent with customary banking practices in the State of Colorado. 4. Fees and Expenses. In connection with the preparation of the Loan Documents and the making of the Loan, (a) Borrower shall be responsible for the costs and expenses set forth in the Disbursement Request and Authorization, and (b) Borrower shall be responsible for the reasonable out-of-pocket fees of external counsel to Lender, provided Borrower shall not be responsible for legal fees in excess of$ 10,000. Any additional costs and expenses which are not expressly set forth in the Disbursement Request and Authorization shall be subject to Borrower’s prior written approval. 5. Personal Property. In no event shall the Lender be deemed to have a security interest in, and the terms “Collateral”, “Property” and “Personal Property” shall not be deemed to include, any furniture, fixtures, equipment and personal property of Borrower, other than such “fixtures” which are permanently attached to and incorporated into the Improvements. 6. Material Adverse Effect. The words “material adverse effect”, “material adverse change” or other phrases of similar import used in any of the Loan Documents or in this Amendment shall be deemed to mean any event, circumstance or condition that has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a materially adverse effect on (a) the business, financial condition or results of operation of Borrower, (b) the ability of Borrower to perform its payment obligations under the Loan Documents, or (c) the rights and remedies of Lender under the Loan Documents. Borrower shall provide Lender with prompt written notice (not to exceed 30 days) of any event Borrower reasonably determines to constitute a material adverse effect. 7. Lender’s Access to the Project. Except in the exercise of Lender’s rights and remedies in connection with an uncured default by Borrower which continues beyond all applicable notice and cure periods, in any other event where Lender is permitted to enter, access or inspect the Project or the Collateral, Lender shall not, in the exercise of such rights, impair or interfere with the construction or completion of the Project, Borrower’s use of the Project or Borrower’s business operations therefrom. 8. Hazardous Substances. Borrower shall be entitled to use, generate, manufacture, store, treat, dispose of, or release, Hazardous Substances which are reasonable and customary in connection with the construction of the Project and Borrower’s use and operation of the Project, all in compliance with applicable Environmental Laws. Each representation and warranty of Borrower concerning the use, generation, manufacture, storage, treatment, disposal of, release or threatened release of Hazardous Substances shall be deemed to represent and warrant that no such use, generate, manufacture, store, treat, dispose of, release or threatened release of Hazardous Substances occurred, to Borrower’s actual knowledge, in violation of applicable Environmental Laws. In addition, each representation and warranty of Borrower in all of the Loan Documents concerning Hazardous Substances and\/or Environmental Laws is modified to provide that Borrower represents and warrants, to its actual knowledge, that such act, condition or circumstance which Borrower represents and warrants is not reasonably likely to result in a material adverse effect. Lender will be responsible for all costs incurred by Lender to make such inspections and tests as Lender deems reasonably appropriate to determine compliance of the Property with the Loan Documents, provided that if Borrower is reasonably determined to be in breach of the hazardous materials provisions of the Loan Documents (subject to applicable notice and cure periods) or there is a reasonable likelihood that the Property is not in compliance with applicable Environmental Laws, then Borrower will reimburse Lender for Lender’s reasonable and actual out-of-pocket costs inclined to make such inspections or tests 9. Insurance. Borrower’s insurer will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Lender with at least 20 days’ prior written notice of cancellation due to non-payment and at least 60 days’ prior written notice of cancellation due to non-renewal. Borrower will provide Lender with 10 days’ prior written notice of any cancellation or decrease in insurance coverage below the amounts required under the Loan Documents. Borrower shall have no obligation to obtain federal crop insurance. Borrower shall have no obligation to furnish Lender with any report summarizing its existing insurance policies and the terms thereof. The “Application of Proceeds” paragraph set forth on page 3 in the Construction Deed of Trust and “Application ofInsurance Proceeds” paragraph on page 2 of the Commercial Security Agreement are hereby modified to provide that (a) Borrower will provide Lender with written notice of any material loss or damage to the Property, and (b) in the event of a casualty or loss, Borrower shall have the right to retain all of the insurance proceeds to repair the Improvements, provided that if the insurance proceeds are not reasonably sufficient to complete the repair and Borrower does not elect, in its sole discretion, to pay the deficiency, then Lender may elect to receive and retain the insurance proceeds to reduce the Indebtedness. Lender acknowledges that it has reviewed Borrower’s existing insurance coverage. Lender confirms that Borrower’s existing insurance coverage is acceptable to Lender and Borrower will not be required to increase or make any other modifications to its existing coverage. Lender further agrees that notwithstanding anything in any of the Loan Documents to the contrary, Borrower’s insurance policies may include a deductible of $5,000. 2 10. Force Majeure; Lender Delay. Borrower’s obligations under the Loan Documents, including, without limitation, the obligation to commence and complete construction of the Project by certain dates and the conversion of the Loan from a draw down line of credit to a permanent loan, are subject to extension for “Force Majeure.” For purposes hereof, “Force Majeure” shall mean any delay resulting from explosion, casualty, flood, hurricane, tornado, the elements, acts of God or the public enemy, sabotage, war, invasion, insurrection, rebellion, civil unrest, riots, earthquakes, inability to obtain permits and materials despite Borrower’s use of commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the same, or other similar events beyond the control of Borrower, provided that in no event shall Force Majeure include financial inability. In addition, Borrower’s obligations under the Loan Documents to commence and complete construction of the Project by certain dates are subject to extension for any delay caused by Lender or any employee, agent or representative of Lender. 11. Default Provisions; Rights and Remedies on Default Provisions. The “Payment Default” default section in all of the Loan Documents is modified to provide that an Event of Default shall only exist if such payment is not made when due, and such failure continues for 10 days after Borrower receives written notice of such failure, provided that if Lender has provided 1 written default notice in any 6 month period, then even if such failure may have been cured within such 10 day cure period, any subsequent failure to make payment during such 6 month period shall be deemed an Event of Default without any notice from Lender. The “Other Defaults” default section in all of the Loan Documents is modified to add the words “relating to the Property” after the word “agreement” and before the word “between”. The “Default in Favor of Third Parties” default section in all of the Loan Documents is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following: “Borrower or any Grantor defaults under any loan, extension of credit, security agreement, purchase or sales agreement relating to the Property, or any other agreement relating to the Property, in favor of any other creditor or person, which, in all events, results in a material adverse effect”. The “False Statements” default section in all of the Loan Documents is modified to provide that an Event of Default shall only exist if such warranty, representation or statement was false or misleading in any material respect at the time made or furnished, or in connection with the Senior Financing or relating to the Property at any time hereafter becomes false or misleading, and the same results in a material adverse effect. The “Defective Collateralization” default section in all of the Loan Documents is modified to add the words “other than as a result of any act or omission of Lender” at the end of that sentence after the word “reason” and before the period. The “Breach of Construction Contract” default section in all of the Loan Documents is modified to provide that an Event of Default shall only exist if the Improvements are not constructed in material conformance with the Plans and Specifications or the Construction Contract. The “Cessation of Construction” default section in the Construction Loan Agreement is modified to provide that a cessation of work for more than 10 days will not constitute an Event of Default if Borrower has provided Lender with prior written notice of reasonable grounds for such cessation and such cessation of work will not have a material adverse effect. The “Transfer of Property” default section in the Construction Loan Agreement is modified to provide that the transfers described in Section [20(b)] of this Amendment are permitted and will not constitute an Event of Default. The “Insecurity” and “Adverse Change” default sections are deleted in their entirety from ail of the Loan Documents.

MERCURY PAYMENT SYSTEMS, LLC, A DELAWARE LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY (\"Borrower\") promises to pay to Alpine Bank, A Colorado Banking Corporation (\"Lender\"), or order, in lawful money of the United States of America, the principal amount of Ten Million & 00\/100 Dollars ($10,000,000.00), together with interest on the unpaid principal balance from December 31, 2012, until paid in full. PAYMENT. Subject to any payment changes resulting from changes in the Index, Borrower will pay this loan in accordance with the following payment schedule, which calculates interest on the unpaid principal balances as described in the \"INTEREST CALCULATION METHOD\" paragraph using the interest rates described in this paragraph: 18 monthly consecutive interest payments, beginning January 31, 2013, with interest calculated on the unpaid principal balances using an interest rate of 4.500%: 101 monthly consecutive principal and interest payments in the initial amount of $51,978.06 each, beginning July 31, 2014, with interest calculated on the unpaid principal balances using an interest rate based on the JP Morgan Chase Bank prime rate as posted at www.jpmorganchase.com (currently 3.250%), plus a margin of 0.550 percentage points, resulting in an initial interest rate of 3.800%; and one principal and interest payment of $7,659,964.60 on December 31, 2022, with interest calculated on the unpaid principal balances using an interest rate based on the JP Morgan Chase Bank prime rate as posted at www.jpmorganchase.com (currently 3.250%), plus a margin of 0.550 percentage points, resulting in an initial interest rate of 3.800%. This estimated final payment is based on the assumption that all payments will be made exactly as scheduled and that the Index does not change: the actual final payment wifi be for all principal and accrued interest not yet paid, together with any other unpaid amounts under this Note. Unless otherwise agreed or required by applicable law, payments will be applied to Alpine Protection Plus, then to Escrow payments, then to Accrued Interest, then to Principal, then to any Late Charges, then to Collection Costs. Borrower will pay Lender at Lender's address shown above or at such other place as Lender may designate in writing. VARIABLE INTEREST RATE. The interest rate on this Note is subject to change from time to time based on changes in an independent index which is the JP Morgan Chase Bank prime rate as posted at www.jpmorganchase.com (the \"Index\"). The Index is not necessarily the lowest rate charged by Lender on its loans. If the Index becomes unavailable during the term of this loan, Lender may designate a substitute index after notifying Borrower. Lender will tell Borrower the current Index rate upon Borrower's request. The interest rate change will not occur more often than each day. Borrower understands that Lender may make loans based on other rates as well. The Index currently is 3.250% per annum. The interest rate or rates to be applied to the unpaid principal balance during this Note will be the rate or rates set forth herein in the ’’Payment\" section. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Note, after the first payment stream, the interest rate for each subsequent payment stream will be effective as of the due date of the last payment in the just-ending payment stream. NOTICE: Under no circumstances will the interest rate on this Note be less than 3.250% per annum or more than (except for any higher default rate shown below) the lesser of 24.000% per annum or the maximum rate allowed by applicable law. Whenever increases occur in the interest rate, Lender, at its option, may do one or more of the following: (A) increase Borrower’s payments to ensure Borrower’s loan will pay off by its original final maturity date, (B) increase Borrower's payments to cover accruing interest, (C) increase the number of Borrower’s payments, and (D) continue Borrower's payments at the same amount and increase Borrower's final payment. INTEREST CALCULATION METHOD. Interest on this Note is computed on a 365\/360 basis: that is, by applying the ratio of the interest rate over a year of 360 days, multiplied by the outstanding principal balance, multiplied by the actual number of days the principal balance is outstanding. All Interest payable under this Note is computed using this methgck This calculation method results in a higher effective interest rate than the numeric interest rates stated in this Note. (Initial Here i  PREPAYMENT: MINIMUM INTEREST CHARGE. Borrower agrees that all loan fees and other prepaid finance charges are earned fully as of the date of the loan and will not be subject to refund upon early payment (whether voluntary or as a result of default), except as otherwise required by law. In any event, even upon full prepayment of this Note, Borrower understands that Lender is entitled to a minimum interest charge of $250.00. Other than Borrower's obligation to pay any minimum interest charge, Borrower may pay without penalty all or a portion of the amount owed earlier than it is due. Early payments will not, unless agreed to by Lender in writing, relieve Borrower of Borrower's obligation to continue to make payments under the payment schedule. Rather, early payments will reduce the principal balance due and may result in Borrower’s making fewer payments. Borrower agrees not to send Lender payments marked \"paid in full\", \"without recourse\", or similar language. If Borrower sends such a payment. Lender may accept it without losing any of Lender's rights under this Note, and Borrower will remain obligated to pay any further amount owed to Lender. All written communications concerning disputed amounts, including any check or other payment instrument that indicates that the payment constitutes \"payment in full\" of the amount owed or that is tendered with other conditions or limitations or as full satisfaction of a disputed amount must be mailed or delivered to: Alpine Bank, A Colorado Banking Corporation; Alpine Bank Durango; 400 7th Street South; Rifle, CO 81650. LATE CHARGE. If a payment is 10 days or more late, Borrower will be charged 5.000% of the unpaid portion of the regularly scheduled payment. INTEREST AFTER DEFAULT. Upon default, including failure to pay upon final maturity, the interest rate on this Note shall be increased to 24.000%. However, in no event will the interest rate exceed the maximum interest rate limitations under applicable law. DEFAULT. Each of the following shall constitute an event of default (\"Event of Default\") under this Note: Payment Default. Borrower fails to make any payment when due under this Note. Other Defaults. Borrower fails to comply with or to perform any other term, obligation, covenant or condition contained in this Note or in any of the related documents or to comply with or to perform any term, obligation, covenant or condition contained in any other agreement between Lender and Borrower.

This obligation to indemnify and defend shall survive the payment of the Indebtedness and the satisfaction of this Agreement. Maintenance of Casualty Insurance. Grantor shall procure and maintain all risks insurance, including without limitation fire, theft and liability coverage together with such other insurance as Lender may require with respect to the Collateral, in form, amounts, coverages and basis reasonably acceptable to Lender and issued by a company or companies reasonably acceptable to Lender.

If Grantor at any time fails to obtain or maintain any insurance as required under this Agreement, Lender may (but shall not be obligated to) obtain such insurance as Lender deems appropriate, including if Lender so chooses \"single interest insurance,\" which will cover only Lender's interest in the Collateral. Application of Insurance Proceeds. Grantor shall promptly notify Lender of any loss or damage to the Collateral, whether or not such casualty or loss is covered by insurance. Lender may make proof of loss if Grantor fails to do so within fifteen (15) days of the casualty.

Any proceeds which have not been disbursed within six (6) months after their receipt and which Grantor has not committed to the repair or restoration of the Collateral shall be used to prepay the indebtedness. Insurance Reserves. Lender may require Grantor to maintain with Lender reserves for payment of insurance premiums, which reserves shall be created by monthly payments from Grantor of a sum estimated by Lender to be sufficient to produce, at least fifteen (15) days before the premium due date, amounts at least equal to the insurance premiums to be paid. If fifteen (15) days before payment is due, the reserve funds are insufficient, Grantor shall upon demand pay any deficiency to Lender. The reserve funds shall be held by Lender as a general deposit and shall constitute a non-interest-bearing account which Lender may satisfy by payment of the insurance premiums required to be paid by Grantor as they become due. Lender does not hold the reserve funds in trust for Grantor, and Lender is not the agent of Grantor for payment of the insurance premiums required to be paid by Grantor. The responsibility for the payment of premiums shall remain Grantor's sole responsibility. Insurance Reports. Grantor, upon request of Lender, shall furnish to Lender reports on each existing policy of insurance showing such information as Lender may reasonably request including the following: (1) the name of the insurer; (2) the risks insured; (3) the amount of the policy; (4) the property insured; (5) the then current value on the basis of which insurance has been obtained and the manner of determining that value; and (6) the expiration date of the policy.

At Lender's request, Grantor additionally agrees to sign all other documents that are necessary to perfect, protect, and continue Lender's security interest in the Property. This includes making sure Lender is shown as the first and only security interest holder on the title covering the Property. Grantor will pay all filing fees, title transfer fees, and other fees and costs involved unless prohibited by law or unless Lender is required by law to pay such fees and costs. Grantor irrevocably appoints Lender to execute documents necessary to transfer title if there is a default. Lender may file a copy of this Agreement as a financing statement. If Grantor changes Grantor's name or address, or the name or address of any person granting a security interest under this Agreement changes, Grantor will promptly notify the Lender of such change. GRANTOR'S RIGHT TO POSSESSION. Until default, Grantor may have possession of the tangible personal property and beneficial use of all the Collateral and may use it in any lawful manner not inconsistent with this Agreement or the Related Documents, provided that Grantor’s right to possession and beneficial use shall not apply to any Collateral where possession of the Collateral by Lender is required by law to perfect Lender's security interest in such Collateral. If Lender at any time has possession of any Collateral, whether before or after an Event of Default, Lender shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of the Collateral if Lender takes such action for that purpose as Grantor shall request or as Lender, in Lender's sole discretion, shall deem appropriate under the circumstances, but failure to honor any request by Grantor shall not of itself be deemed to be a failure to exercise reasonable care. Lender shall not be required to take any steps necessary to preserve any rights in the Collateral against prior parties, nor to protect, preserve or maintain any security interest given to secure the Indebtedness. LENDER'S EXPENDITURES, if any action or proceeding is commenced that would materially affect Lender's interest in the Collateral or if Grantor fails to comply with any provision of this Agreement or any Related Documents, including but not limited to Grantor's failure to discharge or pay when due any amounts Grantor is required to discharge or pay under this Agreement or any Related Documents, Lender on Grantor's behalf may (but shall not be obligated to) take any action that Lender deems appropriate, including but not limited to discharging or paying all taxes, liens, security interests, encumbrances and other claims, at any time levied or placed on the Collateral and paying all costs for insuring, maintaining and preserving the Collateral. All such expenditures incurred or paid by Lender for such purposes will then bear interest at the rate charged under the Note from the date incurred or paid by Lender to the date of repayment by Grantor. All such expenses will become a part of the indebtedness and, at Lender's option, will (A) be payable on demand; (B) be added to the balance of the Note and be apportioned among and be payable with any installment payments to become due during either (1) the term of any applicable insurance policy; or (2) the remaining term of the Note; or (C) be treated as a balloon payment which will be due and payable at the Note’s maturity. The Agreement also will secure payment of these amounts. Such right shall be in addition to all other rights and remedies to which Lender may be entitled upon Default. DEFAULT. Each of the following shall constitute an Event of Default under this Agreement: Payment Default. Grantor fails to make any payment when due under the Indebtedness.

Default in Favor of Third Parties. Grantor defaults under any loan, extension of credit, security agreement, purchase or sales agreement, or any other agreement, in favor of any other creditor or person that may materially affect any of Grantor's property or ability to perform Grantor's obligations under this Agreement or any of the Related Documents. False Statements. Any warranty, representation or statement made or furnished to Lender by Grantor or on Grantor s behalf under this Agreement or the Related Documents is false or misleading in any material respect, either now or at the time made or furnished or becomes false or misleading at any time thereafter. Defective Collateralization. This Agreement or any of the Related Documents ceases to be in full force and effect (including failure of any collateral document to create a valid and perfected security interest or lien) at any time and for any reason. Insolvency. The dissolution of Grantor (regardless of whether election to continue is made), any member withdraws from the limited liability company, or any other termination of Grantor's existence as a going business or the death of any member, the insolvency of Grantor, the appointment of a receiver for any part of Grantor's property, any assignment for the benefit of creditors, any type of creditor workout, or the commencement of any proceeding under any bankruptcy or insolvency laws by or against Grantor. Creditor or Forfeiture Proceedings. Commencement of foreclosure or forfeiture proceedings, whether by judicial proceeding, self-help, repossession or any other method, by any creditor of Grantor or by any governmental agency against any collateral securing the Indebtedness. This includes a garnishment of any of Grantor's accounts, including deposit accounts, with Lender. However, this Event of Default shall not apply if there is a good faith dispute by Grantor as to the validity or reasonableness of the claim which is the basis of the creditor or forfeiture proceeding and if Grantor gives Lender written notice of the creditor or forfeiture proceeding and deposits with Lender monies or a surety bond for the creditor or forfeiture proceeding, in an amount determined by Lender, in its sole discretion, as being an adequate reserve or bond for the dispute. Events Affecting Guarantor. Any of the preceding events occurs with respect to any guarantor, endorser, surety, or accommodation party of any of the Indebtedness or guarantor, endorser, surety, or accommodation party dies or becomes incompetent or revokes or disputes the validity of, or liability under, any Guaranty of the Indebtedness. Adverse Change. A material adverse change occurs in Grantor's financial condition, or Lender believes the prospect of payment or performance of the Indebtedness is impaired. Insecurity. Lender in good faith believes itself insecure. Cure Provisions. If any default, other than a default in payment is curable and if Grantor has not been given a notice of a breach of the same provision of this Agreement within the preceding twelve (12) months, it may be cured if Grantor, after Lender sends written notice to Grantor demanding cure of such default: (1) cures the default within twenty (20) days; or (2) if the cure requires more than twenty (20) days, immediately initiates steps which Lender deems in Lender's sole discretion to be sufficient to cure the default and thereafter continues and completes all reasonable and necessary steps sufficient to produce compliance as soon as reasonably practical. RIGHTS AND REMEDIES ON DEFAULT. If an Event of Default occurs under this Agreement, at any time thereafter. Lender shall have all the rights of a secured party under the Colorado Uniform Commercial Code. In addition and without limitation, Lender may exercise any one or more of the following rights and remedies: Accelerate Indebtedness. Lender may declare the entire Indebtedness, including any prepayment penalty which Grantor would be required to pay, immediately due and payable, without notice of any kind to Grantor. Assemble Collateral. Lender may require Grantor to deliver to Lender all or any portion of the Collateral and any and all certificates of title and other documents relating to the Collateral. Lender may require Grantor to assemble the Collateral and make it available to Lender at a place to be designated by Lender. Lender also shall have full power to enter upon the property of Grantor to take possession of and remove the Collateral. If the Collateral contains other goods not covered by this Agreement at the time of repossession, Grantor agrees Lender may take such other goods, provided that Lender makes reasonable efforts to return them to Grantor after repossession. Sell the Collateral. Lender shall have full power to sell, lease, transfer, or otherwise deal with the Collateral or proceeds thereof in Lender's own name or that of Grantor. Lender may sell the Collateral at public auction or private sale. Unless the Collateral threatens to decline speedily in value or is of a type customarily sold on a recognized market, Lender will give Grantor, and other persons as required by law, reasonable notice of the time and place of any public sale, or the time after which any private sale or any other disposition of the Collateral is to be made. However, no notice need be provided to any person who, after Event of Default occurs, enters into and authenticates an agreement waiving that person's right to notification of sale. The requirements of reasonable notice shall be met if such notice is given at least ten (10) days before the time of the sale or disposition. All expenses relating to the disposition of the Collateral, including without limitation the expenses of retaking, holding, insuring, preparing for sale and selling the Collateral, shall become a part of the Indebtedness secured by this Agreement and shall be payable on demand, with interest at the Note rate from date of expenditure until repaid. Appoint Receiver. Lender shall have the right to have a receiver appointed to take possession of all or any part of the Collateral, with the power to protect and preserve the Collateral, to operate the Collateral preceding foreclosure or sale, and to collect the rents from the Collateral and apply the proceeds, over and above the cost of the receivership, against the Indebtedness. The receiver may serve without bond if permitted by law. Lender's right to the appointment of a receiver shall exist whether or not the apparent value of the Collateral exceeds the Indebtedness by a substantial amount.

CO 81650\n■ii (800) 551-6098\n  Principal Amount: $10,000,000.00 Date of Note: December 31, 2012 PROMISE TO PAY. MERCURY PAYMENT SYSTEMS. LLC, A DELAWARE LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY {\"Borrower\") promises to pay to Alpine Bank. A Colorado Banking Corporation {\"Lender\"), or order, in lawful money of the United States of America, the principal amount of Ten Million & 00\/100 Dollars ($10,000,000.00), together with interest on the unpaid principal balance from December 31. 2012, until paid in full. PAYMENT, Subject to any payment changes resulting from changes in the Index, Borrower will pay this loan in accordance with the following payment schedule, which calculates interest on the unpaid principal balances as described in the \"INTEREST CALCULATION METHOD\" paragraph using the interest rates described in this paragraph: 18 monthly consecutive interest payments, beginning January 31. 2013. with interest calculated on the unpaid principal balances using an interest rate of 4,500%; 101 monthly consecutive principal and interest payments in the initial amount of $51,978.06 each, beginning July 31, 2014. with interest calculated on the unpaid principal balances using an interest rate based on the JP Morgan Chase Bank prime rate as posted at www.jpmorganchase.com {currently 3.250%). plus a margin of 0.650 percentage points, resulting in an initial interest rate of 3.800%: and one principal and interest payment of $7,659,964.60 on December 31, 2022. with interest calculated on the unpaid principal balances using an interest rate based on the JP Morgan Chase Bank prime rate as posted at www.jpmorganchase.com {currently 3.250%). plus a margin of 0.550 percentage points, resulting in an initial interest rate of 3.800%. This estimated final payment is based on the assumption that all payments will be made exactly as scheduled and that the Index does not change: the actual final payment will be for all principal and accrued interest not yet paid, together with any other unpaid amounts under this Note. Unless otherwise agreed or required by applicable law, payments will be applied to Alpine Protection Plus, then to Escrow payments, then to Accrued Interest, then to Principal, then to any Late Charges, then to Collection Costs. Borrower will pay Lender at Lender's address shown above or at such other place as Lender may designate in writing. VARIABLE INTEREST RATE. The interest rate on this Note is subject to change from time to time based on changes in an independent index which is the JP Morgan Chase Bank prime rate as posted at www.jpmorganchase.com (the \"Index\"). The Index is not necessarily the lowest rato charged by Lender on its loans. If the Index becomes unavailable during the term of this loan, Lender may designate a substitute index after notifying Borrower. Lender will tell Borrower the current Index rate upon Borrower's request. The interest rate change will not occur more often than each day. Borrower understands that Lender may make loans based on other rates as well. The Index currently is 3.250% per annum. The interest rate or rates to be applied to the unpaid principal balance during this Note will be the rate or rates set forth herein in the \"Payment\" section. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Note, after the first payment stream, the interest rate for each subsequent payment stream will be effective as of the due date of the last payment in the just-ending payment stream. NOTICE: Under no circumstances will the interest rate on this Note be less than 3.250% per annum or more than (except for any higher default rate shown below) the lesser of 24.000% per annum or the maximum rate allowed by applicable law. Whenever increases occur in the interest rate, Lender, at its option, may do one or more of the following: (A) increase Borrower’s payments to ensure Borrower’s loan will pay off by its original final maturity date, (B) increase Borrower's payments to cover accruing interest, (C) increase the number of Borrower's payments, and (D) continue Borrower’s payments at the same amount and increase Borrower’s final payment. INTEREST CALCULATION METHOD, Interest on this Note is computed on a 365\/360 basis; that is, by applying the ratio of the interest rate over a year of 360 days, multiplied by the outstanding principal balance, multiplied by the actual number of days the principal balance is outstanding. All interest payable under this Note is computed using this methgd-. This calculation method results in a higher effective interest rate than the numeric interest rates stated in this Note. (Initial Here ■ ) PREPAYMENT: MINIMUM INTEREST CHARGE. Borrower agrees that all loan fees and other prepaid finance charges are earned fully as of the date of the loan and will not be subject to refund upon early payment (whether voluntary or as a result of default), except as otherwise required by law. In any event, even upon full prepayment of this Note, Borrower understands that Lender is entitled to a minimum interest charge of $250.00. Other than Borrower's obligation to pay any minimum interest charge, Borrower may pay without penalty all or a portion of the amount owed earlier than it is due. Early payments will not, unless agreed to by Lender in writing, relieve Borrower of Borrower's obligation to continue to make payments under the payment schedule. Rather, early payments will reduce the principal balance due and may result in Borrower's making fewer payments. Borrower agrees not to send Lender payments marked \"paid in full\", \"without recourse\", or similar language. If Borrower sends such a payment, Lender may accept it without losing any of Lender's rights under this Note, and Borrower will remain obligated to pay any further amount owed to Lender. All written communications concerning disputed amounts, including any check or other payment instrument that indicates that the payment constitutes \"payment in full\" of the amount owed or that is tendered with other conditions or limitations or as full satisfaction of a disputed amount must be mailed or delivered to: Alpine Bank, A Colorado Banking Corporation; Alpine Bank Durango: 400 7th Street South; Rifle, CO 81650. LATE CHARGE. If a payment is 10 days or more late, Borrower will be charged 5.000% of the unpaid portion of the regularly scheduled payment. INTEREST AFTER DEFAULT. Upon default, including failure to pay upon final maturity, the interest rate on this Note shall be increased to 24.000%. However, in no event will the interest rate exceed the maximum interest rate limitations under applicable law. DEFAULT. Each of the following shall constitute an event of default (\"Event of Default\") under this Note: Payment Default. Borrower fails to make any payment when due under this Note. Other Defaults.

Without limiting the foregoing, Contractor shall treat as FIS’s Confidential Information all information received from FIS that is designated as “confidential” at or prior to disclosure. FIS designates as FIS Confidential Information (i) this agreement, (ii) any information obtained from or related to any client of FIS including, without limitation, FIS client business strategy, direction and contract information, (iii) any “non-public personal information” as defined in the Privacy of Consumer Financial Information Rule (12 CFR Part 573) or Section 504 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley (“NPI”) or information that is protected under any health privacy such as HIPAA or its state law equivalents, (iv) FIS’s employee records (name, address, salary, taxpayer or government identification number, date of birth, health records, bank account information, labor party), (v) any business strategies and directions, operating or marketing plans, intellectual capital or trade secrets, (vi) memos or other documents or communication; and pertaining to pending litigation, or contracts, and (vii) specifications, research, discoveries, ideas, know-how, designs, drawings, flow charts, budget figures, and other financial and business information, or any such information of FIS’s clients, parents, affiliates, subsidiaries or agents, which is disclosed, regardless of the manner of disclosure, to Contractor.

The costs of such notifications, and any other costs related to such unauthorized possession or use shall be the sole responsibility of Contractor. Confidential Information shall remain the property of the party from or through whom it was provided. Except for NPI, Contractor shall not be obligated to preserve the confidentiality of any information that: (i) was previously known; (ii) is a matter of public knowledge; (iii) was or is independently developed; (iv) is released for disclosure with written consent; or (v) is received from a third party to whom it was disclosed without restriction.

Contractor shall not export any of FIS’s Confidential Information or other data to any country outside of the United States other without the prior written consent of FIS. 2 Privacy. If and to the extent Contractor receives, stores or accesses any NPI or other materials that, in FIS's reasonable determination, are the subject of relevant privacy laws, rules or Privacy Regulations, then Contractor agrees to comply with the requirements of such Privacy Regulations.

Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Services Addendum No. 4 will have the meanings set forth in the Agreement. Intending to be legally bound, the Parties agree as follows: This Services Addendum No. 4 addresses the provision of the Standard GP Interface for a Customer (Chevy Chase) (the “Initial GP Customer”) using FIS’s proprietary Global Plus solution. Pursuant to a Statement of Work dated March 13, 2018, FIS and InvestEdge have developed a standard interface between FIS’ proprietary GlobalPlus Solution and InvestEdge’s proprietary Application Services (the “Standard GP Interface”). 1. Defined Terms. Any capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Agreement. 2. Standard GP Interface. In the event that FIS determines that the Standard GP Interface should be updated or modified from time to time, the Parties will jointly support the Standard GP Interface by maintaining their respective solutions as necessary for Reseller and InvestEdge to transmit\/receive Customer data under this Services Addendum No. 4 for the Initial GP Customer. 3. Application Services. The “Client Reporting Services” functionality provides the ability to run reports that contain Account performance, holdings and transaction information as provided through Customer data feeds. Customers can create packages of reports, modify report parameters, and run report packages ad-hoc or on a scheduled basis using Customer-designated frequencies and delivery options for print and mailing fulfillment. Note that certain reports require third party data subscriptions. 4. Third Party Ancillary Products (a) Morningstar Data Feed Services The “Morningstar Data Feed Services” functionality includes the loading of Morningstar Mutual Fund and Equity data into the InvestEdge system to be used by Customers subscribing to the Application Services pursuant to the terms set forth on Exhibit B. which is attached hereto and made a part hereof. (b) S&P Index Data The “S&P Index Data” service provides daily performance returns and sector weightings for the indexes below to be used by Customers subscribing to the Application Services for stock sector attribution reporting and comparisons on performance reports. I SERVICES ADDENDUM NO. 4 INITIAL GLOBAL PLUS CUSTOMER • S&P 500 and sector level indices • S&P 400 and sector level indices • S&P 600 and sector level indices • S&P Composite 1500 and sector level indices • S&P 100 (no sector level indices) S&P 500 Equal Weighted and sector level indices 5. Term. The term of this Services Addendum No. 4 will commence on the Services Addendum Effective Date and will end upon the earlier of: (i) expiration of the Initial Customer’s Subscription Term, (ii) expiration or termination of the agreement between FIS and the Initial GP Customer for the Global Plus solution or (ii) expiration or termination of the Agreement, in accordance with Section 13 of the Agreement. The subscription for the Initial Customer shall begin on October 3 I, 2018 or as mutually agreed upon and continue for an initial period of two (2) years and renew thereafter for successive one (1) year periods unless Reseller provides termination notice within 60 days of the expiration of the initial period or the renewal period (collectively, the “Subscription Term”). 6. Fees. (a) Application Services Reseller will pay InvestEdge a I\/I2111 portion of the Annual Service Fee on a monthly basis for the Initial Customer Account using the Client Reporting Services in accordance with this Section 7. Accounts Annual Service Fee 0-25,000 $18.00 25,001 -50,000 $17.00 50,001 - 75,000 $16.00 75,001 - 100,000 $15.00 100,001 + $12.00 Example: If Client A has 10,000 accounts using the service, Client B has 20,000 accounts using the service and Client C has 23,000 accounts using the service, the annual Client Reporting services fees to be paid to InvestEdge by FIS would be $923,000 (25,000 accts x $18 per account plus 25,000 accts x $17 per account plus 3,000 accts x $16 per account). Account Minimum InvestEdge will charge Reseller an initial minimum Annual Service Fee for each Customer (“Annual Minimum Fee”). InvestEdge will charge Reseller an Annual Minimum Fee that is equal to the per-Account Annual Service Fee for a minimum of 1,000 Accounts. Reseller will not be charged any incremental per-Account Annual Service Fees for a Customer until the number of Accounts loaded for that Customer exceeds 1,000 Accounts. Example: Customer A has 800 Accounts, Reseller would be charged an Annual Service Fee for Customer B of $18,000 (1000 Accounts x $18 per Account, assuming the total accounts using the 2 SERVICES ADDENDUM NO. 4 INITIAL GLOBAL PLUS CUSTOMER Application Services is less than or equal to 25,000). Two months later, 1,200 Accounts are loaded for Customer A. Reseller would then be charged an Annual Service Fee for Customer A of $21,600 (1200 Accounts x $18 per Account). Customer Subscription Termination Should a Customer discontinue use of the Application Services prior to the end of the Subscription Term, Reseller shall pay InvestEdge 80% of Annual Service Fees due for the remaining Subscription Term. Example: Client A subscribes for the Application Services for 5 years. After the 3rd anniversary of the subscription, Client A has 3,500 account using the Application Services and discontinues use of the Application Services. Reseller would pay InvestEdge $100,800 (3,500 accounts x $18\/acct x 2 years remaining on the subscription x .80).

Overview The current IP Management system, while able to manage the current infrastructure, does not have additional tools and capabilities to move Metavante into the future. We have about 1,200 IP addresses available to manage which means that we can only add 1,200 devices to our network before we reach our capacity. This will cause problems as our company continues to grow. Additional IP addresses can be purchased but our current version does not allow for proper management of the addresses. This proposal will upgrade our management systems with a more robust and manageable version to allow us to perform the management process more efficiently. For more detail please see investment proposal NWS195-07. II. Agreement Summary 1) Tenn\/Pricing: Tiered license pricing, fixed for six years. Support pricing based on 15% of net license fee paid, with annual increases not to exceed 5% versus existing 15% of list price per license. 3) IP Address Licensing terms: Metavante has the right to burst above the actual licensed IP Addresses ( up to 20% of the base ) at no-charge, however Lucent has the right to audit twice per year ( January and June ) to determine the actual number of IP Addresses deployed. If Metavante has more IP Addresses deployed than licensed, then Metavante is obligated to purchase the net number of licenses actually deployed above the base. 4) IP Classic versus Active. Lucent grants Metavante the right to convert all Classic IP Addresses to Active IP Addresses, at no-charge ( Si0,000 value ). 5) Audit Manager software is provided at no-charge for the first 35,000 existing licenses ( $8,400 value ). 5) IP Address license fee reduction ( Classic Comparison ): 40,000 IP Address Order in 2002: $ 1.65 each Current order of Additional 65,000 IP Addresses: $0.93 each 43% reduction in price. ( see attached 2002 Lucent invoice ) 5) Product Acceptance: Not required. HI. Savings Summary Net Value of cunent order: $ 100,593 Due Diligence Savings: Conversion to Active IP Addresses: $10,000 First 35,000 Active Audit Manager licenses: $8,400 Total: $18,400 Hard Savings: 65,000 ($1.65-($2.18 * .6)) = $22,100 Total IV Recommendation Based on the willingness of the supplier to meet Metavante’s business requirements, and investment proposal NWS 195-07, it is recommended that this Agreement be approved.

As such Exhibit 1, April 2007 Price List, hereto is hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth. Immediate Purchase: Shall be pursuant to the mutually acknowledged quotation for such purchase referencing this Agreement. Support and Subscription: Pricing for Support and Subscription Services is 15% of Net price for 8x5 support not to exceed $100,000.00 US per year so long as the license count does not exceed One Million Addresses [each address is a License]. Support and Subscription services shall be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Remote Technical Services SOW. If the license count does exceed One Million Addresses at the time of renewal then, the parties agree to renegotiate the price for Support and Subscription based upon the then-current standard pricing for Support and Subscription Services. License Buffer Conditions: Definitions Maintenance Year: The twelve-month period in which Software support service “Support and Subscription Services” are provided to Customer by ALU. The Support and Subscription Service will be provided in accordance with ALU’s then current offering and are renewable each year and must be paid-up annually in advance. Buffer Object Count (“Buffer”): The number of Objects Customer has been granted a conditional and temporary but renewable right to use above the number of licenses that were paid for on or about the previous year’s 12-Month anniversary of the “Maintenance Year”. Actual Use Object Count: The number of Objects counted as a result of the object count script described herein (Baseline is 50,000 Classic or 35,000 Active) Scope of Agreement As of the effective date of this agreement, Customer has paid for the right to use, 50,000 Classic or 35,000 Active Object Licenses (Paid-Up Licenses). However, Customerjias requested that it be granted a right to use a “Buffer” of Licenses above the number of Licenses for which it has paid. Customer wishes to be charged a right to use fee and a maintenance fee according the number of Licenses it has placed in Actual Use and accordingly retain a “Buffer” of Licenses. In consideration for mutual promises set forth \/sht 7\/796 c ifiles\/form s\/m esa.doc herein, ALU agrees to grant Customer a TERM LICENSE to use a “Buffer” of Licenses in combination with Customer’s Paid-up Licenses according to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. Customer may use all licenses granted (either by grant of Term License or by grant of Perpetual License) on a single server or on multiple servers so long as the license granted is not exceeded. TERM LICENSE: Under the conditions set forth herein, Customer is granted a TERM LICENSE to use 20% over the amount of Paid-up licenses. The TERM LICENSE consists of a combination of a “Buffer” count of Objects which are not in “actual use” and the actual number of Customer paid-up right to use licenses for objects. The duration of the TERM LICENSE is twelve (12) months commencing January 1st and ending December 31st. Except for the duration of the License granted, all other terms and conditions of the controlling agreement apply to this grant. ALU will issue a “temporary key” which will enable the Licenses and the Buffer (20% over the Actual Use Audit Count) described herein for the 12-Month Term. This “temporary key” must be renewed in accordance with this agreement if Customer wishes to continue to use the TERM Licenses and the Buffer past the date of expiration of the “temporary key”. As of the effective date of this agreement, the Buffer is: QIP license “right to use” 20% over and above the Paid-Up licenses and modules for 12 months commencing January 1st and ending December 31st. Upon issuance of “Buffer” temporary key by ALU, Customer agrees to destroy all QIP license keys in its possession or control that exceed the Paid-up licenses plus the 20% Buffer. ' TERM LICENSE RENEWAL: Customer may qualify to be granted additional 12 Months use of the Licenses and the Buffer described above for the term of the Agreement. If Customer follows the steps outlined below, an additional 12-Month Term License identical to the grant described herein shall be granted to Customer. A. QIP OBJECT COUNT AUDIT Customer agrees to use the 50,000 Classic or 35,000 Active IP Addresses (Paid-up Licenses) as an initial Baseline and agrees to a minimum yearly maintenance fee based upon the pricing for Support and Subscription as set forth herein. Customer further agrees to accurately represent the number of Objects it is actually using over and above the Baseline and to pay for additional Licenses it has placed in Actual Use and is using and for software support and Subscription of all Licenses. To audit Customer’s representations, twice during the Maintenance Year (once at renewal of the Support and Subscription Services at the commencement of the maintenance year and once again during the following six-months of the maintenance year) ALU’s Support Center will contact Customer to obtain Customer’s actual “Object Count”. Customer will run a “QIP Object Count Audit Script” (Script that will calculate the number of active objects.) The Script will be provided by the ALU Support Center. The total figure generated by the Script is the number of objects requiring a License to use. (Actual Count of Objects) If Customer has not already purchased the additional right to use Licenses over the baseline (“N” below) then Customer is responsible for purchasing the additional RTU’s and associated support and \/sht 7\/Z96 c: fi I e s\/fo rnis\/m es a. d oc subscription. For the mid year Audit any additional maintenance payments will be pro-rated. If there is a new license, at any time during any fiscal your, ALU will issue a new Term License key, for balance of the term. B. FEES: CALCULATION Upon each audit, Customer agrees to pay Fees for both RTU and Maintenance for Licenses based upon the number of Licenses actually being used over the previous audit count Baseline (Actual Count of Objects) which may be revealed after the QIP Object Count Audit Script is run. Calculation of charges is based on formula: Q-B = N: “Q” = Result of running the QIP OBJECT COUNT AUDIT SCRIPT “B” = The Baseline- derived from counting total Paid-up Licenses each year starting with 50,000 Classic or 35,000 Active upon execution of this agreement. “N” = Number of Licenses which must be purchased TERMINATION OF TERM LICENSE Without Cause: In the event that Customer wishes to discontinue renewal of the TERM LICENSE under the conditions described herein, Customer shall retain,the right to use the number of Paid-Up DHCP Objects in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Customer will not be granted a right to use the “Buffer”. FOR CAUSE: ALU may immediately terminate the TERM LICENSE for the Buffer if Customer fails to perform the QIP AUDIT or any of its material obligations under this Agreement and such failure is not corrected within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice of the breach thereof from the ALU.

The terms and conditions attached hereto as Attachment A shall govern this SOW. To be eligible for RTS-A service, all software for which the service is purchased must be at the most current generally available revision level. Tire right-to-use (RTU) license and any associated hardware upgrades (if required) Tor obtaining the most current generally available revision level is not included in RTS-A service. The customer for the service (“Customer”) is responsible for separately purchasing any additional hardware or software to gel to the current release if required for an upgrade, 1. TERM The word “Term” includes the Initial Term and any Renewal Terms, as defined herein. The “Initial Term” will begin dh the day the purchase order for the RTS-A is accepted unless otherwise agreed in writing and will continue for one year. RTS-A may be renewed for successive calendar year terms (each a “Renewal Term”) upon written agreement of die parties. 2. SUPPORT LEVELS RTS-A is offered at four Support Levels, Standard (8x5), Global Standard (8X5), Premium (7x24) and Global Premium (7X24). Standard Support in-hours provides access to remote engineers in the 8AM-5PM time zone corresponding to Customer's address listed on the Order. Monday-Friday, excluding ALU holidays. For Standard Support, out-of-hours (OOH) support for a Severity 1 outage will be provided on a reasonable efforts basis. Severity Level 2-4 support will be provided on an as-available basis. Global Standard support prorides the same level of support as Standard except SAM-5PM time zone corresponds to the geographic location where product is installed. Premium Support prorides access to remote engineers 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for Severity 1 and 2 issues. Severity 3 & 4 issues can be submitted ria phone or on-line 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, but will be addressed by a remoie engineer during Standard support in-hours. For Premium Support, OOH support for Severity 3 & 4 issues will be provided on an as-available basis. Global Premium support prorides the same level of support as Premium except Standard support in-hours corresponds to the geographic location where product is installed. Customer’s Support Level is as indicated on the SOA. The Customer’s default Support Level shall be Standard. Customer may elect to change its Support Level to a lower level than originally purchased at the end of the Initial Term or any Renewal Term by proriding ALU with written notice al least sixty (60) days prior to the end of the then-current term of Customer’s election to change its Maintenance Support Level. Customer may elect to move from the Standard Support Level to the Premium Support Level at any time upon notice to ALU and by paying the difference in the fees associated with such Support Level change. 3. ALU RESPONSIBILITIES ALU will provided the following services during the Term: 3.1 REMOTE TECHNICAL SUPPORT (RTS) RTS is provided during the applicable coverage period as defined above to respond to Customer’s calls and Web- submitted requests for assistance (Assistance Request or “AR”). An AR will be considered valid when ALU confirms its acknowledgement by providing Customer with an AR tracking number. ALU will acknowledge receipt of a reported AR during the applicable coverage period in accordance with lhe Respond time objectives set forth in Section 3.4 and provide Customer with an AR tracking number. ALU will troubleshoot system problems down io a Maintained Product component level, or sufficiently to exclude Maintained Products as the root cause, ria phone or modem connection. As part of this process, ALU will help identify and support Customer implementation of eligible Software Patches or Software Updates for Maintained Products. Further, ALU will verify customer-detected problems, provided that the problem can be recreated with an unmodified release of tlie Maintained Products. Following verification of the problem, ALU will restore Maintained Products to operational status by providing a software fix and\/or procedural workaround, when feasible. 3.2 DEFINITION OF SEVERITY LEVELS Severity Levels are defined as lhe condition of the Maintained Product when Customer submits an AR. ALU reserves the right to assign a higher or lower Severity Level to a problem once it has verified the problem. Severity Level 1 (Critical): The Maintained Product is inoperative and Customer’s inability to use the product has a critical effect on Customer’s operations. This condition is generally characterized by complete system failure and requires immediate correction. In addition, any condition that may critically impact human safety is considered a Severity Level I problem. Severity Level 2 (Major): The  Maintained Product is partially inoperative but still usable by Customer. The inoperative portion of the product severely restricts Customer’s operations, but has a less critical effect than a Severity Level 1 condition. Severity Level 3 (Minor): The Maintained Product is usable by Customer, but with limited functions. This condition is not critical and docs not severely restrict Customer’s overall operations. Severity Level 4 (Minor): The Maintained Product is usable and the condition docs not materially affect Customer’s operations. Customer suggestions for future improvements are not covered under RTS-A service. 3.3 DEFINITION OF RESPOND, RESTORE, AND RESOLVE RESPOND means a ALU Customer Support Engineer has contacted Customer regarding a particular AR. In the event ALU is unable to contact Customer after three (3) attempts, the AR will be closed; RESTORE means that the problem is remedied sufficiently to return the product or major feature to operational status. Restore may mean that a temporary fix has been provided to temporarily correct the problem, or that a workaround has been implemented, or a method of restoration has been made available to Customer; RESOLVE means that a solution has been provided to address the issue. This may occur simultaneously with Restore, unless the Restore is by means of a workaround suitable only for temporary use and ALU determines that a more suitable permanent solution can feasibly be provided. 3.4 RTS PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES v.010506 Confidential Call Receipt and Routing: for Standard and Premium Coverage is 24X7. The Response time objective for Standard and Premium Coverage for Severity Levels 1 & 2 - 20 minutes: Severity Levels 3 & 4 (In-Hours) - 60 minutes; Severity Levels 3 & 4 (Out-of-Hours) - Next Business Day. The Restore time objectives are as follows: Severity Level 1 - 24 hours; Severity Level 2-72 hours. The Resolve time objectives arc as follows: Severity Levels 1 & 2 (Non-design Change) - 30 calendar days: Severity Levels 3 & 4 (Non-design Change) - 60 calendar days; Severity Levels 1-4. (Design Change) - 180 calendar days. Nori-design Change means changes not requiring a Design Change or development of software code. Design Change means a change in design or development of software code is required, and where ALU elects, based upon its assessment of leclinical and economic feasibility, and subject to the applicable software support policy for the software in question to undertake the same. Add 15 minutes to all performance objectives for ARs submitted via the web. Matters attributable to 3rd party products have performance objectives provided by the 3rd party product and are excluded from Ute metrics above 3.5 WEB- BASED SUPPORT ALU will also proride Customer 24x7 access to the applicable '\"Customer Support” content of the ALU.com Web site(s) (\"ALU.com\") which may include technical product support information, subscription sendees, and other self  help facilities, as well as the ability to submit and status ARs online. ALU.com is used to deliver certain items described below in the Software Maintenance section of this SOW.

SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE The following software maintenance items are provided under RTS-A: 4.1 Software Patches\/Software Updates Software Patches are minor modifications to the Maintained Product to address a specific problem and help restore a Maintained Product. Software Updates are a collection of Software Patches and are sometimes referred to as maintenance releases. Software Updates are generally downloaded via an electronic interface and do not contain any new or additional features beyond what was provided in Customer’s current software release 4.2 Software Upgrades Software Upgrades are releases making more substantial changes than Software Updates. Software Upgrades may contain new features or the addition of enhanced functionality to current products. Any Software Upgrades that may be provided by ALU under the RTS-A service are provided as available, except for those Maintained Products for which the SOA indicates Software Upgrades are not included. ALU does not commit that any Software Upgrades will ultimately be released, made generally available and therefore provided during the Term. Furthermore, ALU does not warrant that any specific features or functionality will be included in any Software Upgrades that may be provided. 4.3 License Terms All software that is ultimately provided in connection with RTS-A service, including without limitation Software Updates, Software Upgrades, Software Patches or workarounds, is licensed subject to die same terms, restrictions, and limitations as contained in the licenses under which die original software was acquired. 5. DISCONTINUED AVAILABILITY AND VERSION SUPPORT The term “Version” as used in this SOW refers to Software Updates as well as Software Upgrades. Beginning on the day Customer has installed (loaded onto a computer) a new Version, ALU will support both the old Version and new Version concurrently for 90 days. Upon completion of the installation of Software Update or Software Upgrade, Customer agrees to destroy the original and all copies of the previous Versions, which are in Customer’s possession or control within 90 days and, if requested, certify such destruction to ALU. In case of discontinued availability (“DA”) of any Maintained Product or Version, RTS will continue to be available, subject to the terms of this SOW, for such Maintained Product or Version for the period stated in a DA notification provided to Customer, which period shall not be less than 12 months from the date of the DA notification [or such other period required under the terms of the agreement pursuant to which the Maintained Product was originally acquired from ALUJ (“the Transition Period”).

Table 3.1 - Duration of Deployment Period 3.2 DEPLOYMENT PERIOD, LICENSE PERIOD AND RIGHTS, AND SUPPORT PERIODS. Right to Deploy and Deployment Period. Provided End User makes payments to EMC in accordance with the Governing Agreement and this Data Sheet, End User shall have the right to Deploy Volume Software during the Deployment Period shown in Table 3.1 below, in amounts no greater than the applicable quantities specified in Table 1.2 above. For the avoidance of doubt, any applicable warranty periods relating to the specific Volume Software titles each commence on the first day the applicable Licensing Unit is Deployed. Entitled Affiiiate(s) may also Deploy and use Volume Software, provided End User ensures its and its Entitled Affiliates’ compliance with the commercial restrictions and other terms of this Data Sheet. For the purposes of ail license paramelers\/quantitics, use of Volume Software by Entitled Affiliates counts as use by End User. End User shall provide written notice to EMC, or EMC’s designee, of the number of licensing units so Deployed within thirty (30) days after the expiration of the Deployment Period. Such notice shall be provided via e-mail to an e-mail address specified by EMC in writing from time to time. End User shall have no right to Deploy or use any Licensing Units of Volume Software that were not Deployed during the Deployment Period. Should End User exceed the applicable Licensing Unit and\/or Support Services quantities specified in Table 1.2 during the Deployment Period or thereafter, End User shall promptly notify EMC and coordinate with EMC to promptly procure (i) license rights for any additional Licensing Units; and\/or (ii) any additional Support Services. 3. 3.1 Grant of License, Duration of License and Redeployment Feature.

Subject to the restrictions of this Section, during (he License Period, EMC grants End User a non-exclusivc, non-transferable to a third party (with the exception of transfer to Entitled Affiliates), license to (i) use Volume Software Deployed during the License Period in an amount that docs not exceed the applicable Licensing Unit and\/or Support Services quantities specified in Table 1.2; and (ii) reproduce Volume Software for use as permitted in this Data sheet provided End User includes al! EMC copyright and proprietary legends in and on each copy. | leployment Period begins on Effective Date\nDeployment Period duration is: Four Years\n3.2.1 Redeployment Feature. EMC and End User recognize that usage requirements may change during the License Period. Provided End User is current in its payments of the applicable license and Support Services fees to EMC, during the Deployment Period End User may satisfy these changed requirements by exercising the Redeployment Feature which rNiiusi HTi^ Ri viontiw EMC Confidential Page 5 of 1! DocuSign Envelope ID: 0BB91088-D5C0-4522-BF19-B19C7126FD24 enables End User lo (i) discontinue its use of all or a portion of the Licensing Units for any previously Deployed Volume Software; and (ii) subsequently Deploy: (a) the same quantity of Licensing Units of the same Volume Software at another Installation Site; or (b) a corresponding increase in the total quantity of Licensing Units of a different Volume Software, with the changes in quantities relating to the Redeployment to be determined using the values listed in Table 1,2 and recorded in an addendum to this TLA signed by both parties (“TLA Addendum”); or (c) a corresponding quantity of Licensing Units of a new software titlc(s) that was not previously included in Volume Software (this new software is referred lo as <fFresh Software”), with the changes in quantities relating to the Redeployment to be determined using the values listed in a revised Table 1.2 that indicates the appropriate values for the Volume Software being discontinued and the Fresh Software and recorded in a TLA Addendum. Upon execution of the TLA Addendum, Fresh Software shall be deemed Volume Software and governed by the terms and conditions of the TLA. End User may use the Redeployment Feature lo further increase the quantity of Fresh Software available for Deployment, but only in an amount no more than ten (10) limes lhe license fee due under the TLA Data Sheet Addendum. For example, if the license fee due under lhe TLA Data Sheet Addendum is $10,000, End User may substitute no more than $100,000 worth of Non-Dcploycd TLA Software. The per-unit pricing used lo calculate the substitution quantities shall be as stated in the revised Table 1.4. Additionally, for the avoidance of doubt, the Redeployment Features set forth in 3.3(aXc) only apply to TLA Software covered by Support Services. Licensing Units which are discontinued in connection with End User’s exercise of the Redeployment Feature may remain in use for a reasonable period of time thereafter to enable migration of any impacted data (“Migration Period\"). However, except for lhe Migration Period described above, in no event shall the total amount of Licensing Units for Volume Software Deployed (including Fresh Software, if any,) at any one time exceed the amount for which End User has paid. 3.22 Volume Software that is not licensed for use on a System shall be installed by End User in lhe manner permitted by the Governing Agreement. 323 Volume Software that is licensed for use on a System shall, unless otherwise agreed tn writing by EMC, be installed and used only on a System that is at the Installation Sile(s) and is within its EMC warranty period or under a separate Support Services contract between End User and EMC (or an authorized reseller thereof). Upon expiration of lhe License Period, and in the absence of a mutually agreed alternative, the license to use al! Volume Software shall immediately cease. End User shall promptly uninstall and permanently delete all copies of Volume Software. Upon EMC’s written request, End User shall sign and provide EMC with an affidavit confirming the decommissioning and\/or deletion of all such Volume Software. The requirements of the preceding clause also apply to all Install Base Licenses which were originally licensed on other than a limited duration, term basis and received Support Services pursuant to this Data Sheet. However, if End User wishes to continue to use Volume Software after expiration of lhe License Period, the parties will use good faith lo implement one of lhe following two (2) options: Option #1 - Renewal of Limited Duration (Term) License - End User notifies EMC, at least six (6) months prior to the expiration of the License Period that End User wants to continue, for another limited duration period of time, to make use of and have lhe right to continue to use of the Volume Software at the Installation Sites and EMC and End User subsequently agree in writing on the applicable terms the “New TLA”). The pricing applicable to End User for Volume Software and Support Services shall be determined by End Userand EMC at the time that End User requests such New TLA. Option #2 - Conversion to Perpetual License - End User notifies EMC, at least six (6) months prior lo expiration of the License Period that End User wants to enter into a new arrangement that allows End User to convert its limited duration (term) licenses to perpetual licenses and EMC and End User subsequently agree in writing on the applicable terms. Where so agreed, lhe Deployed Volume Software shall then be licensed on a perpetual basis, with applicable use rights and Support Services governed by the Governing Agreement and\/or the applicable EMC Product Notice, and subject to lhe terms set forth in the Section entitled “FEE FOR CONVERSION TO PERPETUAL LICENSE\" below. 33 Scope of Support Services. Provided End User has purchased and properly paid EMC for Support Services, EMC will provide or cause to be provided Support Services for the Volume Software during lhe Initial Support Services Period and any Renewal Support Period(s) solely in accordance with the Governing Agreement and the applicable Product Notice(s). 3.4 Termination for Convenience of Support Services. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Governing Agreement, any right of termination for convenience of Support Services stated in the Governing Agreement shall not apply to Support Services provided under this Data Sheet during the Initial Support Services Period. Thereafter, such termination rights will commence on the first day of any Renewal Support Period(s). If End User elects to exercise its termination for convenience right during a Renewal Support Period, any subsequent reinstatement of Support Services, whether during lhe Deployment Period or after its expiration, will be subject to lhe applicable provisions of lhe Governing Agreement. Where End User has exercised its termination for convenience right, from such date onwards End User’s right to Deploy Volume Software will be limited to those versions of lhe Volume Software which were generally available prior to the termination date and for which End User has the existing right to Deploy. 1’NI> USUI -n-A K1£V 2l) I EMC Ccmfideniid Page 6 of 11 DocuSign Envelope ID: 0BB91088-D5C0-4522-BF19-B19C7126FD24 35 Initial Support Period.

The Registered Capacity describes the maximum quantity of data for which the functionality of the Software is authorized for use. The total capacity of the device may exceed the Registered Capacity that the Software is licensed to operate on. Software that is licensed on the basis of Registered Capacity is typically licensed for use only on a specifically identified storage array or other hardware device. Each storage array or other hardware device requires the purchase of (i) an Initial base product (independent of Registered Capacity) and (ii) an additional quantity of add-on products that reflect the amount of Registered Capacity on which the applicable Software is authorized for use. Customers may subsequently determine they need to use the Software in connection with an amount of data that exceeds the current Registered Capacity. In such cases, customers must either purchase on appropriate number of additional licenses to cover the increase in the Registered Capacity. or purchase a new base product plus Software in Instances where a capacity limitation has been reached. Model Specific Terms and Conditions • The purchase of a base product license plus add-on product licenses (which are measured by Registered Capacity) are both needed to use the Software product(s). RAW CAPACITY MODEL MEASURED IN TERABYTES OR GIGABYTES (AS SPECIFIED ON THE QUOTE) Model Description Licensing and pricing is based upon the total capacity of the storage array or other devices on which the Software is licensed for use. Software licensed on the basis of Raw Capacity is typically licensed for use only on a specifically identified storage array. This model uses a \"base plus capacity\" approach as described in the Registered Capacity model above, where the customer purchases one base product license and then purchases incremental capacity add-on product licenses to equal the raw capacity of the system on which the Software will operate. Model Specific Terms and Conditions • A base product license plus add-on product licenses (which are measured by Raw Capacity) are both needed to use the Software product(s). USABLE CAPACITY MODEL MEASURED IN TERABYTES OR GIGABYTES (AS SPECIFIED ON THE QUOTE) Model Description Licensing and pricing are based upon the Usable Capacity of one or more storage arrays, servers, or other devices on which the Software is licensed for use. The Usable Capacity describes the maximum quantity of data for which the functionality of the Software is authorized for use. The Usable Capacity of a licensed device is calculated by MC on the basis of the Raw Capacity minus Overhead. Raw DocuSign Envelope ID: 0BB91088-D5C0-4522-BF19-B19C7126FD24 Capacity is the total data storage capacity of a licensed device. Overhead is that portion of Raw Capacity which EMC determines is reserved for or allocated to spares, RAID types and applications running on a licensed device and on which the software functionality is not to be used. Software that is licensed on the basis of Usable Capacity is typically licensed for use only on a specifically identified storage array or other hardware device. The Customer or Dell EMC may subsequently make a change to the Raw Capacity, configuration. RAID level or overall environment of a licensed device that increases the Usable Capacity to an amount in excess of the quantity for which the Software has been licensed. In these cases. Customer must purchase an appropriate additional license to cover the increase in the Usable Capacity. Model Specific Term and Conditions • The purchase of a base product license plus add-on product licenses [which are measured by Usable Capacity) are needed to use the Software product(s). INSTANCE MODEL Model Description Ucensing and pricing is based upon the nature of the hardware platform on which the Software operates. It includes servers that run a single instance, partition, or virtual machine as well as servers that run multiple instances, partitions, or virtual machines [both physical and virtual machines). Each partition running the application constitutes an instance. This model is also used with server-based Software and Software that is licensed to a specific storage array or to an engine within a storage array. An engine consists of a CPU, cache and data storage (regardless of the speed, performance or capacity of the engine components), as designated by Dell EMC. Adding an engine to an existing storage array enclosure is designated as an upgrade to the existing storage array. This model is also used with clusters. A cluster is a collection of more than one node. Model Specific Terms and Conditions • Server-based Software licensed in accordance with the Instance model is generally priced for a particular OS type, such as Windows. Solaris, etc. • An Instance license may provide support for only a single application type, such as Exchange or Oracle. • Isilon clusters have a minimum of three (3) nodes. MANAGED ENTITY UCENSING MODEL Model Description Licensing and pricing Is based upon the total number of entities being managed or inspected by the Software. An entity is defined as any singular item being managed or monitored by the Dell EMC Software and can include third-party hardware, a running instance of a software program, an abstract resource (such as an email inbox), or a user. The Software licensed under this model may be used on or with a specific entity or quantity of entities of a specified type. Examples of physical devices include, but ore not limited to: routers, switches, firewalls, load balancers, storage arrays, NAS data movers. NAS systems, blades, and IP phones. Examples of instances of a software program include, but are not limited to: databases, volume managers, file systems, operating systems, hypervisors, backup software systems, and CMDB systems, An example of an abstract resource is an email inbox being inspected or managed by the Software product. An example of a user as a managed entity is a user that authenticates to a VPN or some other system using the Software product. A managed entity based on a consistency group consists of a named set of identified storage devices, located at the same physical site, that are treated as a single unit to enable the devices to act in unison to maintain the integrity of data that is distributed across those same devices. For example, devices using the Symmetrix® Remote Data Facility that are identified as belonging to the some consistency group act in unison to preserve the dependent write consistency of a database distributed among the devices in the consistency group. DocuSign Envelope ID: 0BB91088-D5C0-4522-BF19-B19C7126FD24 Model Specific Terms and Conditions • Managed Entity Metric Considerations: Under this licensing model, some Software will be licensed by the total number of entities the Software is interacting with while other Software will be licensed for specifically identified entities. PROCESS RATE LICENSING MODEL Model Description licensing and pricing is based upon the cumulative amount of work done by the Software over a specified time period. Model Specific Terms and Conditions • Tiered pricing (price per mailbox decreases as the number of email mailboxes purchased increases). • Licensing for EMC EmalIXtender is limited to the sole and exclusive benefit and use of the user. License rights may not be further assigned or sublicensed to any other party for any other purpose. NAMED USER LICENSING MODEL Model Description Licensing and pricing is based upon the total number of unique named users or seats accessing the Software, whether such users are actively using the Software, or accessing the Software at any given time. If a named user of the Software leaves the employ of the customer, or moves into a role that doesn't require access to the Software, the seat does not have to be relinquished by the customer, but can be reassigned to a different named user. UNIQUE USER VIDEO INSTRUCTOR-LED TRAINING STREAMING LICENSING (\"VILTS\") MODEL Model Description Licensing and pricing is based upon the number of Customer's individual, unique-named employees or agents authorized to view a VILTS course (“Authorized Users\"] and each instance of an Authorized User clicking on or launching a unique VILTS title is deemed a single use of a VILTS license. CONCURRENT USER LICENSING MODEL Model Description This model specifies the maximum number of concurrent users who are accessing the Software at any instance in time. CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT (“CPU\") MODEL Model Description Licensing and pricing is based upon the total number of CPUs present in the computer upon which the Software will operate. A two-tier system is used based on the number of cores present. These two tiers can be combined as needed on CPUs with greater than 12 cores. Neither tier can be split across more than one CPU. INDIVIDUAL CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT (“CPU\") CORE MODEL Model Description Licensing and pricing is based upon the number of \"Cores\" on which the Software will operate. A \"Core\" is defined on the basis of the environment in which the Software operates. DocuSign Envelope ID: 0BB91088-D5C0-4522-BF19-B19C7126FD24 When operating the Software in a \"bare metal\" environment, which means a physical machine without a hypervisor product capable of creating Virtual Machines, and excludes operation within a cloud service environment, a \"Core\" equals a single, computational unit of the processor. When operating the Software in a hypervisor (Virtual Machine) environment, a \"Core\" equals a single unit of virtual processing power (commonly referred to as a \"vCPU'j configured to each Virtual Machine. A Virtual Machine is a software container able to run its own operating system and execute applications, just as a physical computer does. When operating the Software in a public cloud services env'ronment, a \"Core\" equals a single, basic, most granular unit of computational power as defined by the cloud service provider. This may include, but is not limited to such units expressed as the number of “vCPUs.\" \"virtual CPUs,\" \"virtual cores,\" and \"dynos.\" When used with respect to Pivotal software titles, please reference the Pivotal Product Guide posted at www.oivotol.io\/product-quide for a complete description of this licensing model (including the meaning of defined terms) in lieu of the above. CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT (“CPU') MEASURED BY MSU MODEL Model Description Licensing and pricing is based upon the maximum combined capacity of the CPUs contained within a mainframe device, os determined by the industry standard measurement of Millions of Service Units (MSU) to reflect the processing power of the mainframe device, irrespective of the type of processor or the workload.

DESCRIPTION OF THE SERVICES 3.1 3.1 Background, Objectives and Critical Success Criteria (to this SoW) Background This SOW is to engage Endava to provide Java application development and testing services that would migrate the current PayByBank Application code-base to OCP 4.0 without going through GPPaaS as well as to release the software into production environment and provide subsequent BRO support for an initial period of 3 months. Endava shall provide the Client with one near-shore team to provide development and testing services, in accordance with the direction and prioritisation provided by the Client. The technology solution is based upon JAVA, specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. Endava will follow an agile development process for this Statement of Work. Construction activities will take place in cycles known as sprints (“Sprint\"). User requirements will be written in the form of user stories (“User Stories\") along with associated acceptance criteria (“User Story Acceptance Criteria\"). Endava will work with the Client to continuously provide effort estimates for and prioritise User Stories according to business value, effort estimates, critical path and dependencies. Each Sprint will end with a Sprint demo session to demonstrate to the Client the progress made during the current Sprint, followed by a retrospective session to support the continuous improvement of the adaptive development process, based on feedback from Endava teams and Client. 3 DocuSign Envelope ID: BE366786-C014-4156-9F51-81233EB6B455 Objectives Code developed by the Endava team is in a state of completion to allow a first merchant to be boarded in the pilot phase by end of Q2\/2022.

The candidate services being considered for the BRO model under this Work Package are listed below: a. PBBA (Pay By Bank Application) is a new payment method being developed by MasterCard and piloted with Barclays and HSBC. It allows users to pay from their banking application using a simple 6 character code shown at checkout. The Pay By Bank Service is an adapter that sits between Worldpay's gateways and PBBA themselves, enabling any gateway to sdateprocess payment requests to them without knowing any specifics of the implementation. 2. The service can be deployed within a platform as a service cluster called RedHat OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) which handles most of the operational aspects of the service. The platform itself handles all things related to availability, scalability, security and abstracts the interaction with the hardware resources. Services run within isolated components called Pods and this minimizes the risk of undesired cross services access. 3. Worldpay's processes for managing incidents out of hours will be followed. This includes but is not limited to alerts configured to go to the Global Technology Service Centre GTSC first line support team for service level breaches. Knowledge articles to be written by the BRO Team to define what steps need to be followed should the alert be raised. If the GTSC is unable to resolve the incident the escalation will be done to the BRO Team. 4. Worldpay will be responsible for assigning priority levels to the incidents in accordance with Annex 2. 5. The IT Supplier Personnel allocated to the BRO model will have a dedicated maintenance and support capacity. It is accepted that the capacity of the development team may reduce in order to perform Incident Management and Problem Management activities such as service restoration, root-cause analysis, remediation and mitigation against further incidents. This reduction in capacity may impact sprint commitments. If so, this will be clearly communicated between Endava and Worldpay leadership. 6. Endava will select the IT Supplier Personnel to be allocated to the BRO model based on their skills, motivation and availability for On-Call. The initial setup for the BRO support team will be by using the senior technical people from multiple teams, by 18 DocuSign Envelope ID: BE366786-C014-4156-9F51-81233EB6B455 rotation. Any particular Problem that the senior technical person cannot solve during On-Call Support will be immediately picked by the team assigned to the service during Normal Working Hours. 7. Application and provision of the BRO model will not require Endava to access personal data. 19 DocuSign Envelope ID: BE366786-C014-4156-9F51-81233EB6B455 ANNEX 2 - BRO Incident Priorities Criticality\/Priority levels Definition Critical (P1 Major Incident Event): • Immediate, widespread and large-scale Customer impact. • Immediate significant revenue impact to Worldpay with high long term fall out • Direct threat or damage to image, reputation or credibility of Worldpay - media attention highly likely. • Multiple business functions critically impacted.

(2) The cache run volumes increase throughout the day as on-line volumes decrease (3) The peak window for the cache run is 12:00 Midnight Eastern Time to 7:00 AM Eastern Time as this is the low on¬ line usage window (4) There is no cache run in from 8:00 AM Eastern Time to 1:00 PM Eastern Time as this is the peak on-line period for Internet traffic (5) When a user initiated refresh (Active Refresh) is executed then cache schedule for those accounts are rescheduled for the next update window 6. PRIORITY DEFINITIONS. (a) Measurement of Service Issue. All Yodlee Service and software issues are measured by the following three categories: (1) level of business impact, (2) features being impacted, (3) number of users impacted. (b) Level of Business Impact. The business impact can range from high to low: (1) High business impact is when the company incurs significant loss due to loss of service or core system functions cannot be performed by the company or its end users. (2) Medium business impact is incurred when there is a partial loss of core functionality for a limited set of users, which indicates that there are some corner cases which require a detail analysis. Likely in order to troubleshoot these type of issues, Yodlee will need to collect user specific logs in order to identify a permanent solution. (3) Medium to low impact is when there is loss of minor functionality for the company or its end users. Low impact is when a small subset of the company's end users are impacted by the partial loss of minor functionality. (c) Feature Types: (1) In general for the Yodlee service and application there are core features and minor features. Core features are those process stop features. If a core feature is not performing it means that there is no work around and the company and its end users cannot perform core business service functions. (2) Minor feature set, as defined in this document, refer to the feature types which are not core but they may be supporting core features. These functions may not result in failure of core features but are likely to request the end user to undergo extra steps in order to perform a core system function. Look and feel and end user preferences are considered minor features. (d) User Population. Understanding the number of the users impacted is crucial in troubleshooting an issue. If all users are impacted it is a direct implication that there is an infrastructure problem or core software issue in the logical flow that needs to be addressed. If a low number of users are impacted it is also a direct implication that the scenario is likely a corner case which needs additional research in order to be addressed.

(b) If Company detects a P1 incident; Company will notify Yodlee support by opening a Service Request in the Yodlee CustomerCare tool and also via phone (1-800-928-3457). For P2 and P3 incidents, Company will notify Yodlee support by opening a Service Request in the Yodlee CustomerCare tool. (c) Upon receipt of notification, Yodlee shall assign a Service Request to the incident reported by Company and provide a tracking number to Company. (d) Regardless of the mechanism used to report the incident, if Company does not receive a response from Yodlee within the guidelines set forth in Section 7 (Technical Support Response Time Table) of this SLA, Company should contact Yodlee per SLA Exhibit III below. (e) Support hours of operation are 7x24x365. (f) Yodlee expects Company to identify, investigate and attempt to resolve all End-User issues prior to contacting Yodlee, and should only escalate Customer problems to Yodlee after exhausting all reasonable means available to Company to resolve the problem, including Yodlee support tools, product documentation and training. In the event Company is not able to resolve the problem, it should be escalated to Yodlee Support using the above process. End¬ User email threads should not be forwarded to Yodlee Support without summarized detail. Company should have the following information available when opening a Service Request in the Yodlee CustomerCare tool: 1. Date Observed: 2. Feature: 3.

Company Controlled includes all changes that are defined as part of the Cobranded Application. These are changes that Yodlee will present to Company for review, testing, and approval prior to any change being made. These changes will be scheduled by during a time mutually agreed to by both parties. Yodlee is responsible to ensure Cobranded Application changes are controlled and approved by Company. (b) Yodlee Controlled. Yodlee Controlled includes all changes that are not defined as part of the Cobranded Application changes. These include the shared infrastructure such as network devices, data base servers, back¬ end processing, and all related software. These changes will be managed by Yodlee's formal Change Management process and Yodlee shall endeavor to provide Company with at least ten (10) days' notice of any scheduled changes. 10. PRODUCT LIFECYCLE. Yodlee will support the then-current Major Release of each Service plus two Major Releases back (e.g., if the then-current Major Release is 9.x, support per this SLA would be provided for versions 9.x, 8.x, and 7.x) (“Supported Releases”). If a Defect is discovered concerning a Supported Release, Yodlee will respond and address the Defect in accordance with the provisions of this SLA. Yodlee will make new Major Releases generally available to its company no more frequently than once per year on average. Once a Major Release is more than two versions older than the then-current Major Release, that version will be deemed “EOL\" as of the General Release date of the newest Major Release. If Company does not upgrade from an EOL version to a Supported Release, the following will apply: (i) Defect support per this SLA will no longer be available, and Yodlee will attempt to answer questions concerning the EOL version but will not be bound by the requirements of this SLA; and (ii)Company will owe an additional annual EOL version fee equal to the greater of 30 percent (30%) of the Maintenance and Support Fee stated on the Fee Schedule or Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000), effective immediately and continuing until such time that Company upgrades to a Supported Version. By way of example only: when the most recent Generally Available Major Release is version 9.x, versions 9.x, 8.x and 7.x are Supported Releases, while versions 6.x and older will be deemed EOL versions and will no longer be supported per this SLA. A company declines to upgrade from EOL version 6.x to a Supported Release, resulting in the Defect support provisions of this SLA no longer applying. In addition, that company immediately owes Yodlee an additional annual EOL version fee equal to 30% of the Maintenance and Support Fee stated on the Fee Schedule in that company's services agreement with Yodlee. 11. MINOR AND MAINTENANCE RELEASES. In conjunction with the above Product Lifecycle, Yodlee will provide Company with Minor Releases and Maintenance Releases on a periodic basis for no additional fee. The frequency of Maintenance Releases will depend upon the number of field reported escalations from Company and\/or Defects reported from Yodlee Support, Operations, Engineering and QA groups. For P1 issues Yodlee will promptly provide a Hotfix once that fix becomes available (coded and tested). Page 26 of 40 DocuSign Envelope ID: A352F2B4-3E3A-401C-8305-F08613625F02 Yodlee will also provide Company with new Major Releases that continue or enhance existing functionality of the Services during the Term for no additional fee other than a Professional Services Statement of Work for implementation services associated with upgrading Company to the new Major Release; provided that if portions of such new Major Releases incorporate new product modules for which Yodlee charges its clients an additional license and\/or maintenance fee, Company will have the option to (i) license such new product modules for such additional fees, or (ii) elect to decline such additional modules and receive only those portions of the subsequent Major Release that provide the same functionality and features as previously licensed by Company. 12. TRAINING. Yodlee shall provide Company with four (4) hours of training (“training the trainer”) and training support materials in order for Company to train Company call center associates. Yodlee error codes will be listed within the training documents provided to Company for reference. 13. COMPANY RESPONSIBILITIES. (a) Company shall designate up to four named contacts as authorized support contacts. All Service Requests into Yodlee Support should come from one of these designated contacts. Company may reasonably change the authorized contacts from time to time, provided that Company notifies Yodlee Support in writing (email acceptable) in advance of such changes. (b) Company will supply an email alias to Yodlee for Support and Operations notifications (for proactive support notifications, i.e. Data issues, product issues, etc). Company will maintain and monitor this alias. (c) Company will provide Tier 1 support to End-Users. Company will manage and perform all communication with Customers. At no time will Yodlee be expected to communicate directly with Customers. (d) Company will ensure that phone center and operations center staff is trained on the Service(s) and on support processes. 14. OPERATIONAL REPORTS. Yodlee to provide the following to Company on a monthly basis: (a) Monthly Uptime Report (see SLA Exhibit I) (b) Maintenance Notification Report (c) Root Cause Analysis Report (P1 incident) (See SLA Exhibit II) 15. DISASTER RECOVERY. Yodlee shall provide business continuity, disaster recovery, and backup capabilities and facilities, through which Yodlee will be able to perform its obligations hereunder without unreasonable disruptions or delays pursuant to Yodlee's standard Disaster Recovery service. Upon request, Yodlee shall provide to Company summaries of the business continuity, disaster recovery plans. Disaster Recovery services (e.g. non-standard testing, enhanced restoration times) that exceed Yodlee's standard Disaster Recovery service will be subject to additional fees. 16. ADDITIONAL CONTACTS Each party will also designate and provide contact information for the party's official representative with responsibility for issues concerning (i) Fraud, (ii) Risk, and (iii) Security, which representative will be contacted in the event of an issue or incident concerning the Services related to those areas of responsibility. Each party may reasonably change the authorized contacts from time to time, provided that the party notifies the other in writing in advance of such changes.

Your obligations You would appreciate that this assignment would involve close interaction between the management of the companies and our engagement team. While it will be our endeavor to complete the assignment, however, this is dependent on the support and co-operation of the companies and their response time. We accordingly look forward for the following: ► Designate a competent employee or employees to be responsible for the engagement; Page 5 of 15 EY Building a better working world ► Provide the data and information required for timely carrying out the work.

Inevitably, it is not possible to guarantee that the tax authorities will not challenge a transaction or our interpretation of the relevant tax law nor to guarantee the outcome of such a challenge if raised. ► Should you have any contact from tax authorities in respect of transactions on which we are advising you, you are recommended to contact us for advice on how to proceed. 6.

Unless billed and paid locally, all amounts billed in foreign currency will be converted to U.S. dollars at the time of settlement.

Full cooperation means that each Participant will provide EY in a timely manner with a properly completed electronic tax data organizer (unless EY has agreed to accept information in an alternative format and it and Client have agreed on the additional compensation attendant to such alternative), and will be responsive to requests for additional information. EY will bring to Client’s attention any situation in which EY is not receiving full cooperation. EY will not be responsible for more than 3 attempts to secure information and at that time will escalate such issues to Client and Client will assume responsibility for obtaining the missing information from the Participant. In such instances where Client requests EY to continue to attempt to secure missing information, an additional charge will apply at our agreed rates. ► EY receives complete and accurate compensation information from the Client on a timely basis in a format that can be imported into our compensation bridging system. ► EY receives (as applicable) from each Participant and, where applicable, the Participant's spouse, an executed consent authorizing the disclosure of the Participant’s tax return information to other members of the EY global network that will assist in the preparation of the Participant's home and host country income tax returns. ► There are no material changes to applicable current U.S. federal and state laws and, where non-U.S. returns are to be prepared by EY International, Ltd. or EY Global Limited member firms, applicable laws of the foreign country. 4.2.

Consistent build and deployment is vital to ensuring programme & production standards are met, and to minimise deployment, release, and integration issues. A consistent build system is used by all projects to ensure all the deployable artefacts from all the projects are built to the same standard, and to provide full traceability for all releases. Configuration propert ies are used to configure deployable artefacts for a specific environment al deployment time. They are also used to configure Virtual Machines, Platforms, databases, and deployable artefacts. There are a lot of properties that are common to configuring these items. tslafet have been requested to provide specialist Oracle fusion Middleware resource to build and support an application build and release strategy, with a suitable standardised toolset and assist in the training of WorldPay resources who will have ownership in the future.

Constraints The delivery of this SOW may be constrained by agile methodology. As such the Product Owner is ultimately responsible for ensuring the appropriate business priority is given to the developing user requirements and the order in which they are delivered, The Product Owner may choose to 'update' existing functionality over new requirements at their discretion. As a large programme of work, there arc many inter wave dependencies, these may impact what and when functionality is delivered by these teams. These inter wave dependencies are managed by the WorldPay Project and Programme Managers 11.
