Neither you nor we shall export, disclose or transfer any such data directly or indirectly without compliance with these and any other applicable laws and regulations. A ¥eijr Ducv tc Provide infoimation You acknowledge that your information is material to BSI providing the Services. Accordingly, you will provide to BSI and any assessor appointed by BSI to conduct assessment services as part of the Services: full, complete and accurate information relevant to the Services, including, if relevant, test calibrations; : : regular updates comprising full, complete and accurate details of any changes to the information since you first provided it to BSI (be advised that such changes, including changes to employee headcount may necessitate increases in audit duration(s) with appurtenant cost differentials); and : any additional information that BSI may request from you as being relevant to the Services. This duty to provide and update information is a continuing one and lasts for the duration of the Contract. In particular, if BSI receives a complaint from a third party that, in the sole opinion of BSI, requires investigation, you will provide such information as BSI may reasonably request (including access to any relevant site) in order for BSI to so investigate it. You undertake warrant and represent that all information bsi provided to BSI for the purpose of the Contract shall be true, accurate and complete, and not misleading. In providing the Services, BSI is entitled to assume that all information that you provide is true, accurate and complete in all respects and that you have complied fully with your duty to provide all relevant information. BSI will not investigate or confirm the truth, accuracy or completeness of any information provided by you and accordingly BSI accepts no liability for any losses, costs or damages suffered or incurred by you arising out of or in relation to the Services provided to you on the basis of information provided by you which is not true, accurate and complete in all respects or which is misleading. Part 5. Provisions relating to Assessments ai’rf Site Visits This Part is relevant for all Services that may include assessments and site visits. 3. Qualification and Selection of Assessors BSI warrants that all assessments will be performed by appropriately qualified and trained assessors exercising the skill, care and diligence as may be reasonably expected of a reputable provider of similar services. In its sole and absolute discretion, BSI will select the appropriate assessors to perform the assessments. BSI may change the assessor at any time. In the event of a change in assessor by BSI, no additional fees will be charged to you. Except where prohibited by scheme rules or regulatory directives, you may request BSI to change the assessor with at least thirty (30) days\\' written notice prior to the commencement of an assessment, provided that you agree to pay any additionai fees or expenses incurred by BSI in providing an alternative assessor. If no appropriate assessor is available, BSI may in its sole and absolute discretion refuse your request. z Arrangement of Assessment Visits to your Sites BSI will arrange visits to your site or sites as expressly described in the Proposal, or, if later, as may be expressly agreed with you in writing. It may be necessary for BSI to visit third party sites not under your direct control, for example critical sub¬ contractors or crucial suppliers (these are sub-contractors and suppliers who provide products or perform services that are material to the subject matter of the Services). In such cases, BSI shall inform you of the need to visit such other sites and you shall procure the right of BSI to enter such sites for the purposes of audit pursuant to the Services. If BSI is not able to enter such additional sites for any reason, such inability may cause a delay to the delivery of the Services, or a termination of the Contract (at the sole determination of BSI). All fees payable for the delayed Services or up to date of termination shall be payable irrespective of BSI\\'s audit of such third party sites. If the timetable for visits is determined by the relevant standard or scheme, you and BSI each agree to comply with that timetable. If the frequency of visits is not fixed by the relevant standard or scheme, BSI will arrange them at its reasonable discretion. In each case, you will provide BSI and its assessor all reasonable access to all and any areas of the site, data and records, and any materials and equipment as the assessor deems reasonably necessary in order to allow the assessor to undertake the assessment. (Change of date of site visit) Either party may change the date of a visit. In order to do this: if you change the date of the visit: you must do so by giving not fewer than thirty (30) days advance written notice to BSI. If you fail to give the required written notice, you will be liable to pay the full fee for the originally booked visit. You may not delay the date of a visit if to do so would have the effect of invalidating your certification; : : if BSI changes the date of the visit: While BSI will endeavor to provide you with as much advance notice as possible under the circumstances, it may do this at any time up to twenty-four (24) hours prior to the booked date of the visit, and BSI will contact you to arrange for an alternate date. In certain circumstances (such as non-compliance with the relevant standard, consummation of a transaction or business reorganization that could materially affect operation of your management system, or investigation pursuant to a third party complaint) it may be necessary for BSI to make additional visits. You will be liable for the fee for any additional visits at the assessment rate set out in the Proposal. Observed visits BSI\\'s assessor may be accompanied by a third party observer from time to time, who is to witness an assessment which may be required by scheme rules or for BSI internal training purposes. BSI will inform you, as well as provide you with the identity of the observer, within a reasonable time prior to the visit. A third party observer will be subject to confidentiality obligations at least to the same level as those to which BSI is bound in accordance with this Contract. The fee for the visit will not be increased due to the visit being observed. 4 Assessors\\' Health and Safety (Hazard^) When an assessor attends your premises, you are responsible for ensuring that adequate information is given on the hazards and risks to which the assessor may be exposed. You will provide the assessor with an appropriate level of supervision as well as all necessary personal protective equipment. You will immediately notify BSI of any event, accident or incident on your premises which could pose a risk to an assessor. (BSI\\'s right to abort a visit) If, while on your premises, the assessor has reason to believe that you are not complying with the relevant health and safety rules, or that the assessor\\'s safety is at risk in any way, then the assessor may abort the visit. BSI will report to you the reasons for the termination of the visit. In such an event, BSI will not be in breach of the Contract and you will be required to pay in full for the Services. BSI will not attend the affected premises again until it is satisfied that the issues so reported have been resolved. Assessors\\' Entry Requirements You must, at the time of arranging a visit, notify BSI of the health and safety rules and any other reasonable security requirements applicable to visitors to the premises. BSI will observe, or will use reasonable endeavors to procure the observance of, as far as it is reasonably able, all such health and safety rules and any other reasonable security requirements that you notify to BSI, and notify to the assessor on arrival at the site. If, by observing these rules and other requirements, BSI is prevented from providing the Services, BSI will not be in breach of the Contract and you will be required to pay in full for the Services. If the Proposal requires a visit to a third party’s premises, you undertake, warrant and represent that you have a relationship with the third party that permits BSI to attend the premises of the third party for the purposes of the Contract. ft Damages for failure to meet the number of audit days requested If, either through your cancellation of agreed and booked audit dates, or through your termination of this Contract prior to our being able to provide you with any of the Services, you fail to meet the number of audit days requested by you (and stated in the Proposal) in any one year, for any reason other than a Force Majeure (please see Part 9, section , below) or our fault, you shall pay to us on demand $150 for each audit day not taken in the relevant year, as liquidated damages. Both of us confirm that this sum represents a genuine pre-estimate of our losses. 7 Term of Proposal If an initial assessment is not conducted within one year of the date of the Proposal due to any reason other than the fault of 651, this Contract shall terminate insofar as it relates to Assessment and Site visits, and you will need to reapply for such services, which may be at other rates to the ones quoted to you in the Proposal. Pan 6 Cert-hcatev and Reports This Part is relevant for all Certificates and reports that BSI may issue or produce pursuant to the Services. 2 Certificates (No automatic right to a Certificate) The Contract does not give you an automatic right to a Certificate. You will be awarded a Certificate if the certification or testing process is successful, in BSl\\'s absolute and sole judgment acting independently to your interests. (BSl\\'s right to refuse a Certificate, or to suspend or revoke it) At its sole and absolute discretion, BSI may refuse to issue a Certificate, or revoke or suspend an issued Certificate, if in its reasonable opinion: i you do not meet, or fail to continue to meet, the relevant standard or regulation; or ; you amend any specification of the product of which the test item was representative and to which a Certificate relates; or you fall to disclose any information to BSI that may affect BSl’s decision to issue or continue the Certificate; or ’ you fail to comply with the continuing obligation to supply information; or ■: you fail to pay any fees due to BSI under the Contract; or 1 in the opinion of BSI, you use the Certificate in a manner that may be misleading or that may bring BSI into disrepute. If BSI revokes an issued Certificate, you will immediately refrain from representing that the revoked Certificate is valid. (Ownership) BSI will at all times remain the owner of a Certificate. BSI grants you a limited non-exclusive license to display the Certificate (and any accompanying BSI logo or certification mark) at your premises or on your products (but only in so far as the scope of the Certificate is relevant) for so long as the Certificate remains valid. You may not sub¬ license or transfer the right to display the Certificate (or the accompanying BSI logo or certification mark) to any other party. You may not amend the content or change the appearance of the Certificate or the BSI logo or certification mark. (.Change of details on a Certificate\\') If you wish to change any details on a Certificate, you will notify BSI of the required changes.
