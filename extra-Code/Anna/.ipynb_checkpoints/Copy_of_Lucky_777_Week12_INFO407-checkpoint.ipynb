The reason for this difference is that line breaks will affect the md5sum. On Project Gutenberg many of the files were created on a machine running the Windows operating system. That will affect how newlines are encoded. On Windows (and DOS as well), line feeds are encoded using the combination of CR and LF (carriage return, line feed) -- or 0x0d0a. Whereas on linux/freebsd/mac that same line feed will be a single 0x0a character. So when you fetch the data it will still have those CR&LF, but as soon as you write it to a file, only the LF will be written. The file will have the number of lines for both, but the number of bytes will be different.\n",
