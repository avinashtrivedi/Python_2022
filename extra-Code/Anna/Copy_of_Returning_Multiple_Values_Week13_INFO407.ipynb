    "##**The return of many**\n",
    "Up until now every function we have written returned a single value. Even when we returned a list of items, that list is still considered a single value. However, there are times when we want a function to return multiple items. Lets look at the current options:\n",
    "\n",
    "##**Use a List**\n",
    "Although a Python list can hold mixed types (strings, numbers, functions), it's usually a good practice to think of a list as containing homogeneous items. It makes processing the list easier.\n",
    "```\n",
    "def get_shopping_item_list():\n",
    "  return ['apple', 10]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The downside is the code calling get_shopping_item (a.k.a. the client) has to remember to index into the list to get the proper value.\n",
    "\n",
    "###**Use a Dictionary**\n",
    "Using a dictionary is also a possibility, but it also puts some coupling (a.k.a. dependence) between the client and the function. Specifically if the author of the function changes the keys of the dictionary, s/he has to inform all those that use the function of the updates.\n",
    "```\n",
    "def get_shopping_item_dict():\n",
    "  return {\n",
    "    'name': 'apple', \n",
    "    'count' : 10\n",
    "  }\n",
    "```\n",
    "###**Use a Tuple**\n",
    "Returning a tuple is similar to returning a list; however the items returned are immutable (you can't change them).\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def get_shopping_item_tuple():\n",
    "  return ('apple', 10)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Coder's Log:*** *Use a Class or Object We haven't seen how to make Python objects yet. This is a perfectly viable solution if the returned class seems like a reasonable container. If the function is returning very disparate items, then making a class or object to hold those items isn't necessarily a good design decision. We will visit making Python Objects in another lesson(s).*"
