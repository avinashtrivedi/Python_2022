      "Middle age is the awkward period when Father Time starts catching up with Mother Nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The stars shall fade away, the sun himself Grow dim with age, and nature sink in years, But thou shalt flourish in immortal youth, Unhurt amidst the wars of elements, The wrecks of matter, and the crush of worlds.\n",

      "\n",
      "To be happy, we must be true to nature and carry our age along with us.\n",

      "It lies in human nature that where you experience your first laughs, you also remember the age kindly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Age is not measured by years. Nature does not equally distribute energy. Some people are born old and tired while others are going strong at seventy.\n",

      "\n",
      "Once a disease has entered the body, all parts which are healthy must fight it: not one alone, but all. Because a disease might mean their common death. Nature knows this and Nature attacks the disease with whatever help she can muster.\n",

      "\n",
      "It's amazing how a competitive nature can turn a negative into something positive.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm from the Madeleine L'Engle school. The more she delves into science, the more she knows there's a creator who's behind these amazing laws, these amazing events. The symmetry of nature, the structure and order of it.\n",
